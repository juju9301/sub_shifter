1
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:39,323
Once, man and those in the water
were linked.

2
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,784
They inspired us.

3
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:44,203
They spoke of the future.

4
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:49,124
Man listened and it became real.

5
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,629
But man does not listen very well.

6
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:59,635
Man 's need to own everything
led him deeper into land.

7
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:03,264
The magic world of the ones
that live in the ocean...

8
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:05,808
...and the world of men...

9
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:08,227
...separated.

10
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:12,731
Through the centuries, their world,
and all the inhabitants of it...

11
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:14,817
...stopped trying.

12
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:19,113
The world of man became more violent.

13
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:25,160
War upon war played out,
as there were no guides to listen to.

14
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:30,541
Now those in the water
are trying again...

15
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,294
...trying to reach us.

16
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:38,424
A handful of their precious young ones
have been sent into the world of man.

17
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:41,302
They are brought in the dead of night...

18
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,847
...to where man lives.

19
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:47,850
They need only be glimpsed...

20
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:51,812
...and the awakening of man
will happen.

21
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:55,357
But their enemies roam the land.

22
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:59,028
There are laws that are meant
to keep the young ones safe...

23
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:03,115
...but they are sent
at great risk to their lives.

24
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:05,117
Many...

25
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:07,286
...do not return.

26
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:13,000
Yet still they try...

27
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,212
...try to help man.

28
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:23,135
But man may have
forgotten how to listen.

29
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:42,947
My daughter says to be careful,
Mr. Heep.

30
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:51,747
Well, it's some kind
of a b... B... B... Bug.

31
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:53,916
It's very big.

32
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,710
It's very hairy.

33
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:05,761
My other daughter says it's
some kind of creature the devil made.

34
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,263
Tell her it's not a creature.

35
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:10,641
There's no such thing as creatures,
all right?

36
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:12,434
You...

37
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:15,187
You might wanna turn away.

38
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:31,495
Sorry this is taking so long.

39
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:47,303
It's over. It's over.

40
00:04:47,636 --> 00:04:50,347
It's... It's safe.

41
00:04:56,353 --> 00:05:01,483
My daughter says
thank you for protecting them.

42
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,282
Mr. Farber?

43
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:11,368
I'm Cleveland Heep.
Welcome to the Cove.

44
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:13,746
Mr. Heep!

45
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:21,086
You are new tenant?

46
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:24,757
Yeah, this is Mr. Farber. He's in 13B.

47
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:28,385
Now, Mr. Farber, this is Young-Soon
Choi. She lives with her mother in 8A.

48
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,931
She's a student at the university.

49
00:05:32,556 --> 00:05:34,850
Young-Soon, you don't know...

50
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:38,771
...who's been swimming in the pool
the last few nights, do you?

51
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,232
No, Mr. Heep.

52
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,610
By the way, here. Thanks. I liked it.

53
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,403
You're welcome.

54
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,824
Mr. Heep loves learning.
He doesn't want people to know.

55
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:56,038
Mr. Heep, pool man looking for you.
I tell him you come soon.

56
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:00,584
Could you wait here just a moment,
please?

57
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:04,255
Gonna ask something. Answer straight.
You guys having parties in here?

58
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:06,799
Bubble parties, bubble bath,
everyone skinny-dipping?

59
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,217
No.

60
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:11,595
- Those bubbles make the water very slick.
- No.

61
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,226
I'll trust you on that. But something
is making this water like this.

62
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:21,063
There has been someone
swimming at nighttime.

63
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:26,068
I hear sp... Sp... Sp...
Splashing some nights.

64
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:30,281
I left here yesterday afternoon,
this filter was empty.

65
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:42,877
You kind of look like maybe
you could work out a little bit, right?

66
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,629
I could give you a vein like that.

67
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:49,466
I could make it look just like this. Right?

68
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:52,428
Most people say,
"What's wrong with you, Reggie?

69
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:55,472
Why you only working out
on one side of your body?"

70
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,311
I tell them it's like an experiment.
I'm like a scientist.

71
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:08,694
This morning I measured my bicep.

72
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:13,115
Four-and-a-half-inch difference
from one side to the other.

73
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:14,867
Look at that.

74
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,328
Take a guess at the difference
between my thighs.

75
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,205
- Hello, Reggie.
- Hey.

76
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,832
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hey.

77
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:24,793
Me and the new guy,
we're talking science.

78
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,588
Okay, that's great. Here we go, Mr. F...

79
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:30,090
Here we go. Come on.

80
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:35,679
Don't hang out in the stairwell,
Reggie, please.

81
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:38,140
- Okay.
- All right.

82
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:42,686
Just... People might trip.

83
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:43,896
All right.

84
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:47,024
Reggie's harmless.
He just wants to be special.

85
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:49,443
He's working out
only one side of his body.

86
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,363
Did he...? Did he tell you that?

87
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,406
- Be inside within minutes.

88
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:55,824
Hello, Mr. Leeds.

89
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:59,703
Those soldiers are only now beginning to
wonder how long they'll end up staying.

90
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,833
If this does come to combat, we will not
be in the battle for the sake of the battle.

91
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:05,584
He's been here f... F... Forever.

92
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,170
- Will not be reached any other way.

93
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:14,301
Mrs. Bell, she takes in animals.
Smart lady. You'd like her.

94
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:20,516
- He... Not just because he died.
- There's a bunch of people better.

95
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:23,185
- Name four people better.
- Name one better than Fred.

96
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:27,773
Axl Rose. Sebastian Bach.
Bret Michaels is better than he is.

97
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,901
Bret Michaels.
I'd rather listen to Bon... Jon Bon Jovi.

98
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:32,236
What? Are you...?

99
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:34,071
This is you.

100
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:42,913
There's no smoking inside.

101
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:47,710
And there's no swimming after 7.

102
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:55,676
I hope it's okay to ask: What brings you
here from the West Coast, Mr. Farber?

103
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:59,013
I've been hired to be the local film
and book critic for the paper.

104
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,182
They flew you all the way
out here for that?

105
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:05,686
- They did.
- Well, you must be very good.

106
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:26,415
Mr. Heep, Betty Pen again.

107
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:30,586
I smell something awful
coming from the upstairs apartment.

108
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:36,008
I think someone may have died
and the body is decomposing.

109
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,553
I know I said this last week, but...

110
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:53,817
Not everyone here
spent Sunday practicing for war.

111
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:58,030
At Sunday church services,
chaplains rallied the troops.

112
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,741
For these Marines,
a moment for prayer...

113
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:06,497
...at a service that many here believe
will be their last before going to war.

114
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:11,836
U.S. Forces predicted today the enemy,
estimated at 3 to 4000...

115
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,671
...may be willing...

116
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:22,763
- a major... A major confrontation.

117
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,685
At the same time, the U.S. Military
will be fighting a propaganda war.

118
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:31,689
If there were a silver bullet,
we would've shot that a long time ago.

119
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:36,128
Hey! I saw you!

120
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,422
I saw you!

121
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:45,763
Come out of that pool right now!

122
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,474
Hey!

123
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:53,646
I'm gonna wait.

124
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,026
Hey.

125
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:05,115
Hey.

126
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:11,872
Come on out, now. It's...

127
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:15,584
It's... It's not safe.

128
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,881
Come on out. This is not f...

129
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:23,717
This is not funny.

130
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:31,934
Please sto...

131
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:02,047
God.

132
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,199
Did you pull me out?

133
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:19,458
Where are you from?

134
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,919
The Blue World.

135
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,421
Is that an apartment?

136
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:28,300
Do you feel an awakening?

137
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,928
I'm sorry?

138
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:34,557
It will feel like pins and needles...

139
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:37,142
...inside.

140
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,274
It is not you.

141
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,532
It's late.

142
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,076
You really...

143
00:14:56,745 --> 00:14:58,956
You shouldn't be here.

144
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:03,836
I'm kind of old-fashioned that way.
I don't even know your name.

145
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,713
My name is Story.

146
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,048
I didn't mean for you to tell...

147
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,848
Why am I not stuttering?

148
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,474
What?

149
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,734
Hello, Story, my name is Cleveland.

150
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:28,861
"From the cliffs."

151
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,989
That is what your name means.

152
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:33,991
Where did you learn that?

153
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:36,076
From my studies.

154
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:43,375
I promise that I will not
get you into trouble. You can go.

155
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:47,338
I am scared.

156
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:51,884
I will wait here with you, Cleveland.

157
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,929
Why are you scared?

158
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:11,070
You can wait here for a little bit...

159
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,864
...until you feel not so scared.

160
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,870
Are you okay?

161
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,839
Oh, my God. You're just a kid.

162
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,443
Hello.

163
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:06,792
Okay. It's time to go. Story, come on.

164
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,468
Okay.

165
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,180
I think you need some fresh air.

166
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:21,515
I'm just gonna take you outside.

167
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,976
I'm gonna put you
on one of the pool chairs.

168
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm gonna get you some coffee...

169
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,939
...and then you can wake up.

170
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:32,526
Then I'll walk you home.

171
00:17:40,868 --> 00:17:44,121
Tell me, who in the world
are you, anyway?

172
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:48,709
- Narf.
- What?

173
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:56,509
Okay. Come on.

174
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,552
Here we go.

175
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:12,525
Okay.

176
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,440
It was sort of h... H... Hairy, but...
But matted, like clumps. You know?

177
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,318
And it was kind of g... Green.

178
00:19:37,484 --> 00:19:39,445
- You say green?
- Yeah.

179
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:43,115
I thought so. Matted is... Is not right.

180
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:48,621
It was f... F... Flat, and...
And thicker than hair.

181
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:54,126
Like this. Like this.
Flat and this kind of a color.

182
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:59,590
- And... Is this not helping you at all?
- Forget about its hair for a second.

183
00:19:59,757 --> 00:20:03,594
It's obviously some dumb animal
who muddied himself. About how tall?

184
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:06,347
- What, was it a Great Dane?
- No, no, no. No, sir.

185
00:20:06,514 --> 00:20:10,518
I mean, are there any w... W...
Wolves in this area? Hyenas?

186
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:14,230
Jack, this is Philadelphia.
Where do you think you're living?

187
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:20,110
Sorry. Something keeps
setting off the sprinklers.

188
00:20:20,277 --> 00:20:23,489
I'll look around the forest and check
behind the dumpsters and stuff.

189
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,908
An animal that size,
the one you're describing...

190
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:27,868
...doesn't walk around and not be seen.

191
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,788
There's nowhere for
a dumb big animal to hide.

192
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:42,341
Cleveland.

193
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:43,485
Hey.

194
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:46,030
Got a lot of homework, huh?

195
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:48,699
University gives many pages of reading.

196
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:51,702
What they think, I have no social life?

197
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:54,705
I got more books for you.

198
00:21:54,872 --> 00:21:58,834
Could you look up
the word "narf" for me?

199
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:03,672
It's an Eastern bedtime story, Mr. Heep.

200
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,049
I do not remember it.

201
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:08,177
My great-grandmother
used to tell it when she was alive.

202
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:10,888
A b... B... B...

203
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:14,225
Bedtime story?

204
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:16,310
What's the story?

205
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,522
I do not remember.

206
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:23,734
How about your mother?

207
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,207
Hello, Mrs. Choi. Hello.

208
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:46,841
She wants to know
who told you this word.

209
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:51,595
Oh, j... Just a friend. I don't...
I don't... I don't know her very well.

210
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:58,143
She said that her grandmother...

211
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:04,441
...used to tell this story like a prayer.
Like it was true.

212
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:11,240
She said that she knew someone
who knew someone who saw one.

213
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:13,200
Saw one what?

214
00:23:17,246 --> 00:23:21,584
A narf, the bedtime story says,
is a sea nymph.

215
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:28,674
I s... What...
What happens in the story, please?

216
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,642
No. Mrs...

217
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,402
In the bedtime story...

218
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:53,991
...she must be seen
by the one human chosen for her.

219
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,167
This person is called the vessel.

220
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:08,422
Seeing the narf will awaken something
in the chosen one.

221
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:11,550
If she's successful in this...

222
00:24:13,177 --> 00:24:18,766
...she will return with the Great Eatlon,
a giant eagle...

223
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:21,352
...and become free.

224
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,980
She won't tell me more.

225
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:29,068
She said, why can't I be like
my older sister. She married a dentist.

226
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,251
Story?

227
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:49,046
Story?

228
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,717
Cleveland.

229
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:02,685
Story, could you
put something back on, please?

230
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:19,076
Are you here to meet someone,
see someone in this building?

231
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:26,458
Is somebody supposed to see you?

232
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:32,256
Is...?

233
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:36,635
L...

234
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:43,976
It is a writer.

235
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,526
Do you know his name?

236
00:25:57,698 --> 00:25:59,992
Do you know what he looks like?

237
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:07,500
Do you know if it's a...?
A woman or a man?

238
00:26:12,296 --> 00:26:15,132
Is there something
that you wanna tell me?

239
00:26:21,472 --> 00:26:26,185
Is this person
writing something important?

240
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:35,027
When do you have to leave?

241
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:39,114
I can leave tonight if I meet this person.

242
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,575
I'm gonna help you get home.

243
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,037
Thank you, Cleveland.

244
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:50,918
I have to go.

245
00:26:56,423 --> 00:26:58,968
Hello. L... l...

246
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,679
I wanted to ask you
something about your work.

247
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:05,266
Your c... C... Critic work.

248
00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:09,186
How's it... How's... How's...
How's it going?

249
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:14,275
I'm seeing a romance film tonight.
Not my cup of tea.

250
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:17,027
So you... You...
You haven't written anything yet?

251
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:18,988
Haven't written anything
for some time.

252
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,074
You were right about that one tenant.

253
00:27:22,283 --> 00:27:24,410
I spoke with Mrs. Bell.

254
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:28,330
We got along.
She's very good with animals.

255
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,458
You know she wrote a book?

256
00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:36,630
Mr. Heep,
I will be taking the cat in directly.

257
00:27:37,214 --> 00:27:38,841
Don't worry, Mrs. Bell.

258
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:43,929
Lookie here.

259
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:49,435
My, there's a lot of butterflies
around this building.

260
00:27:50,394 --> 00:27:55,107
Strange behavior for them.
They're not usually so trusting.

261
00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:01,572
I understand that you're a writer,
Mrs. Bell.

262
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:03,324
Now, where'd you hear such things?

263
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:10,039
Maybe I read your book.

264
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:14,001
That'd be quite a trick.
It's been out of print for 20 years.

265
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:17,630
Twenty years?
So you haven't written anything recently?

266
00:28:17,838 --> 00:28:21,383
Mr. Farber has been speaking
out of turn.

267
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,805
Look at this cereal character's picture,
Dad.

268
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:31,227
Looks like Aunt Sylvia when she found out
everybody hated her fruit-bowl painting.

269
00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:37,066
I need a nine-letter word
for "in human form."

270
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,152
You'll figure it out, Dad.

271
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,154
I...

272
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:46,867
You know, the color on this box
look just like the colors of your car, Dad.

273
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:49,578
Maybe we should take your car
and go visit Aunt Sylvia.

274
00:28:49,745 --> 00:28:51,413
Incarnate.

275
00:28:53,874 --> 00:28:58,379
Well, you're very good
with those word puzzles, Mr. Dury.

276
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:02,091
He's a grand-master level.
I'm gonna be just like him.

277
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:05,386
- So you like words a lot, huh?
- I adore them.

278
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:08,806
Are you... Are you writing anything,
Mr. Dury?

279
00:29:08,973 --> 00:29:10,474
A book, maybe?

280
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:11,851
No, l...

281
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:16,856
I'm afraid my skills are limited
to crossword puzzles.

282
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:20,693
That's some serious reekage, man.

283
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,404
You don't even speak English anymore.

284
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:27,241
What, reekage? Damn straight
it's English. The state of reek.

285
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:29,660
There's no "reekage," man.

286
00:29:29,827 --> 00:29:35,291
Some toker just like us made it up
somewhere, and here you are speaking it.

287
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:39,712
Let's make up a witty phrase.
It'll become famous.

288
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:43,007
It needs to be on some T-shirt
or something, you ass.

289
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:48,512
No, it doesn't. It just catches on.
People just start saying it.

290
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:50,598
Blim-blam.

291
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:53,100
What? Blim-blam?

292
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:55,352
Somebody already said that.

293
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:01,233
Gentlemen, I don't suppose...

294
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,197
...any of you have written
anything lately.

295
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:11,577
An essay or something?

296
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:15,372
Something important?

297
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,374
No essays here, my man.

298
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,048
Okay. Stop putting your clothes
in the garbage disposal...

299
00:30:24,215 --> 00:30:26,717
...and stop smoking.

300
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:36,268
Baby's on the half-tip.

301
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:39,939
- Snap!
- Yeah.

302
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:42,525
There you go. There you go.

303
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:43,901
Mr. Heep.

304
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:47,363
She told me a little bit more of the story
before she throw cushion at me.

305
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,739
Young-Soon.

306
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,368
You're not writing anything, are you?

307
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:56,038
A p... P... P... Paper, maybe?

308
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:58,707
Writing? No, Mr. Heep.

309
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:04,171
This semester all multiple-choice
courses. Young-Soon is not stupid.

310
00:31:05,673 --> 00:31:08,926
She told me about a bad guy in story.

311
00:31:09,093 --> 00:31:12,429
These creatures are called scrunts.

312
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:16,308
They are meant to kill a narf
when she is out of the water.

313
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:19,144
They can lay completely flat.

314
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:22,022
Their back is covered in grass.

315
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:25,860
My great-grandmother said
that's why man never sees them.

316
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:29,321
They will appear
as a bump in the lawns.

317
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:21,749
Vick. Anna.

318
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:25,419
Mr. Heep, the light over my desk
is still not working.

319
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:28,839
I promise I'll get to it.
How's the writing?

320
00:32:29,006 --> 00:32:32,635
- Slow.
- You look tired, Mr. Heep.

321
00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:37,765
How long have you been writing, Vick?

322
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:40,100
Six months.

323
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,562
What? I should finish, right?

324
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:46,941
It just... It just sits on his desk.
My brother's scared.

325
00:32:47,107 --> 00:32:48,984
He'll do anything to get out of writing.

326
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:52,488
See this? It's the third load of laundry
he's done this week.

327
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:56,742
I can fix that light now, if you want.

328
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:41,996
A cookbook.

329
00:33:44,498 --> 00:33:47,209
This has gotten s... S...

330
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:52,214
Silly.

331
00:33:56,385 --> 00:33:59,430
- That's not how you fold.
- Mr. Heep, tell her to stop annoying me.

332
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:00,848
I fixed the light.

333
00:34:01,015 --> 00:34:02,975
I'll make you dinner, Mr. Heep.
Thank you.

334
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:04,560
You're both cooks?

335
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:08,939
Who, him? He can't cook.
He's banned from the kitchen.

336
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:16,989
Wait a minute,
I don't understand something.

337
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,700
I'm sorry. My... My ladder...

338
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:23,537
...accidentally bumped into your desk.

339
00:34:23,704 --> 00:34:27,249
I ended up seeing the title
of what it is you're writing.

340
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:29,084
It said The Cookbook.

341
00:34:29,251 --> 00:34:31,504
I know, it's a bad title, right?

342
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:36,800
It's actually, you know, just my thoughts
on all our cultural problems...

343
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:39,178
...and thoughts on leaders and stuff.

344
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:42,348
I don't know who's gonna
wanna publish the thing.

345
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:46,393
That is not how you fold.

346
00:34:57,988 --> 00:35:00,491
Your thoughts are very sad.

347
00:35:03,994 --> 00:35:06,580
Most are of one night.

348
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:12,211
A night a man entered your home
when you were not there.

349
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:18,050
He stole many things
and killed your wife and children.

350
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:22,179
That is when you stopped being happy.

351
00:35:25,182 --> 00:35:27,226
You were a doctor.

352
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:32,398
I am very sorry for you.

353
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:36,819
You believe you have no purpose.

354
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,572
You help all that live here.

355
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,616
Anybody can do this job, Story.

356
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:45,077
You have a purpose.

357
00:35:45,953 --> 00:35:48,664
All beings have a purpose.

358
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,922
I know who you are.

359
00:35:58,132 --> 00:36:01,927
And I think that I've found your vessel.

360
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:05,014
You know what I'm talking about, right?

361
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:10,102
He's outside.
Do you need to see him alone...

362
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:12,563
...or does he just need to see you?

363
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:25,075
Cover yourself up.

364
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:30,873
Hey.

365
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,626
Mr. Heep, I know I sent in that form.

366
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,170
- I gave it to you on the stairs.
- Okay.

367
00:36:37,004 --> 00:36:40,633
- My sister's all angry at me now.
- Well, I'll check again.

368
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:44,803
By the way, this is my friend, Story.

369
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:49,475
Hi.

370
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:07,701
Yeah, you were right. Here it is.

371
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,496
Great.

372
00:37:13,874 --> 00:37:16,794
You all right? You look a little...

373
00:37:20,464 --> 00:37:22,758
I'm feeling a little funny. It's nothing.

374
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:27,263
Is it a pins-and-needles kind of feeling?

375
00:37:28,722 --> 00:37:30,516
Yeah, kind of.

376
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:34,144
Yeah.

377
00:37:35,896 --> 00:37:38,190
Maybe you should go lie down.

378
00:37:44,196 --> 00:37:45,865
Nice meeting you.

379
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:49,952
I'm so very happy we saw each other.

380
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:15,477
You don't have to leave right now,
do you?

381
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:19,899
I have to go finish a couple of things.
I'll be back.

382
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:21,692
Is that okay?

383
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:24,487
Your words are very beautiful.

384
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:29,074
Your heart is very big.

385
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:42,838
No one knows about my family here.

386
00:38:44,882 --> 00:38:49,845
Please do not bring it up again.

387
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:03,317
Coming.

388
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:09,406
Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Bubchik.
It's... It's been a long day.

389
00:39:09,573 --> 00:39:10,950
Come on.

390
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:17,081
Listen, he's on the toilet.
He's been having some gas issues.

391
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,457
Don't tell him I told you.

392
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:21,544
L... I thought the toilet was broken.
That's why I came.

393
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:26,382
He may just be looking in the mirror.
I mean, he's got this growth on his ass.

394
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:29,301
Don't tell him I told you.

395
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:34,473
Honey, Cleveland's here.
He's come to fix the toilet.

396
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,685
Tell him I had it fixed already.
I called the plumber this morning.

397
00:39:37,852 --> 00:39:40,980
- Don't let it hurt his feelings.
- Right.

398
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:44,400
It's... It's... It's okay.

399
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:48,154
I should come when you call.
It's my job.

400
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,908
What if that thing's out there?
It'll try to get you?

401
00:39:53,075 --> 00:39:55,911
There are laws. It will be safe.

402
00:39:56,078 --> 00:39:58,664
I'm allowed to leave this night.

403
00:40:07,798 --> 00:40:10,384
- How long do you think?
- It is time.

404
00:40:10,551 --> 00:40:11,844
You must not watch.

405
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:14,471
Am I not allowed to watch you leave?

406
00:40:15,472 --> 00:40:16,724
I won't watch.

407
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:20,019
Thank you for letting me wear
your beautiful shirt.

408
00:40:20,186 --> 00:40:21,854
You keep it.

409
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,239
What happened?

410
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:59,201
Okay. Okay.

411
00:41:59,368 --> 00:42:03,956
Hey. Calm down. Calm down.

412
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:06,250
How'd you get those scratches?

413
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:09,503
Did the eagle come?

414
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,258
Did something go wrong? Story.

415
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:17,845
Story. Was it that dog again?

416
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:27,897
What's happening?
I thought it was gonna be safe.

417
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:44,830
Your face doesn't look right.
Are you okay?

418
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:49,460
Mr. Heep is here. He has a friend.

419
00:42:49,627 --> 00:42:51,420
She's beautiful.

420
00:42:51,587 --> 00:42:53,839
She's not feeling that well:

421
00:42:54,006 --> 00:42:55,841
So she's lying down in my room.

422
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:58,427
Why is she here?
Why isn't she at his place?

423
00:42:58,594 --> 00:43:01,764
Well, she got sick
in the stairwell downstairs.

424
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,186
She's wearing no clothes
under his shirt.

425
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:08,771
Blim-blam.

426
00:43:10,564 --> 00:43:13,901
Mr. Heep is a player.

427
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:23,869
- I hope it's all right.
- It's fine.

428
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:25,746
Do we need to take her to a hospital?

429
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:28,707
- Oh, no. No, no, no. That's f... F... F...
- Fine?

430
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:31,502
Thank you.

431
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:34,171
No, she just needs some rest.

432
00:43:34,338 --> 00:43:36,674
She can stay here
as long as she needs to.

433
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,344
You started writing again?

434
00:43:42,388 --> 00:43:43,889
Yeah.

435
00:43:44,473 --> 00:43:47,059
I'll be right back. Okay?

436
00:43:55,484 --> 00:43:59,864
Hello. M... Mrs. Choi,
is Young-Soon at home?

437
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,407
No home.

438
00:44:01,574 --> 00:44:04,326
Great. Unbelievable.

439
00:44:10,499 --> 00:44:13,002
Hey. Hey.

440
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:16,714
Thanks.

441
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:20,259
- Yeah, hello?
- Mr. Heep?

442
00:44:20,426 --> 00:44:22,928
- Where are you?
- At a club.

443
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:25,639
Don 't tell my mother.
She thinks I'm at a dance class.

444
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:27,099
Okay.

445
00:44:27,474 --> 00:44:30,769
What happens if a narf gets scratched?

446
00:44:30,936 --> 00:44:34,940
I don 't know.
Put my mother on, I'll ask her.

447
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,777
Mrs... Mrs. Choi. Mrs...

448
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:55,878
- Hey.
- Hey. Thank you.

449
00:44:57,046 --> 00:44:59,715
Oh, she... She... She...
She doesn't look happy.

450
00:44:59,924 --> 00:45:02,510
She said the story
her grandmother told...

451
00:45:02,718 --> 00:45:05,888
...said a scrunt has poison
that kill narfs.

452
00:45:06,055 --> 00:45:10,309
But she said
narfs can protect themselves.

453
00:45:10,476 --> 00:45:14,230
They are given a mud called Kii
that cures them.

454
00:45:14,396 --> 00:45:16,732
They keep it where they live.

455
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:19,652
Okay, okay.

456
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:25,991
All right. Now, you said that the eagle
comes to take them back.

457
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,994
Right.
Now, what stops this green thing...

458
00:45:29,203 --> 00:45:33,332
...from attacking them
when the eagle comes?

459
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:35,084
You're funny, Mr. Heep.

460
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:37,545
- Yeah, I know.
- You really thought about this.

461
00:45:37,753 --> 00:45:39,922
Put my mom on.

462
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:04,363
- Hey.
- Yeah. Hey. I'm sorry.

463
00:46:04,947 --> 00:46:06,157
Yes?

464
00:46:06,365 --> 00:46:09,368
She said only a rogue scrunt
will break the law of that night...

465
00:46:09,577 --> 00:46:11,370
...because most scrunts are afraid.

466
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:13,289
Afraid of what?

467
00:46:13,497 --> 00:46:18,294
Tartutic. They are the law keepers
in this bedtime story.

468
00:46:18,502 --> 00:46:21,338
Her grandmother said
there are three of them...

469
00:46:21,505 --> 00:46:24,633
...but they are called one name:
Tartutic.

470
00:46:24,842 --> 00:46:29,054
They live in the trees.
They are said to look like monkeys.

471
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:34,643
No one knows for sure because
no one who has seen them has lived.

472
00:46:34,852 --> 00:46:38,898
The legend says
that they were born so evil...

473
00:46:39,064 --> 00:46:42,568
...that they killed their parents
on the night they were born.

474
00:46:42,776 --> 00:46:47,990
The fear of them has kept justice
in The Blue World for centuries.

475
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:50,159
Bye, Mr. Heep.

476
00:46:56,749 --> 00:46:58,209
Thanks.

477
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:19,563
They are given a mud called Kii
that cures them.

478
00:47:19,772 --> 00:47:22,066
They keep it where they live.

479
00:50:21,328 --> 00:50:24,665
My mom figured out I was at a club.
She made me come home.

480
00:50:24,832 --> 00:50:26,625
She tell me more of the story.

481
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:29,503
- Why you wet?
- That's... Apartment business.

482
00:50:31,714 --> 00:50:36,093
Listen, Mr. Heep,
my mother thinks of you as stranger.

483
00:50:36,385 --> 00:50:39,889
You have to make her
see you as a child, innocent.

484
00:50:40,055 --> 00:50:43,017
Then she will tell you the bedtime story.

485
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:45,769
There is a reason
the rules might be broken.

486
00:50:46,896 --> 00:50:49,648
A Thousand Narfs is about a rare narf...

487
00:50:49,815 --> 00:50:52,193
...who comes once
in a generation of narfs...

488
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:55,362
...who is called the Madam Narf.

489
00:50:55,529 --> 00:50:59,033
Her vessel is important.
This vessel will cause change.

490
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,038
But it is the Madam Narf herself
that is truly the key.

491
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:07,708
She's considered
a queen to her people.

492
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:11,629
Her return will be seen
as a great inspiration.

493
00:51:11,795 --> 00:51:15,341
A scrunt will do anything
to kill a Madam Narf...

494
00:51:15,508 --> 00:51:18,219
...even forget his fears of the Tartutic.

495
00:51:18,385 --> 00:51:21,764
He might break the rules for that,
Mr. Heep.

496
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,351
Will she know
that she's a Madam Narf?

497
00:51:25,518 --> 00:51:29,146
No, that is moral of bedtime story.

498
00:51:29,313 --> 00:51:32,358
No one is ever told who they are.

499
00:51:32,525 --> 00:51:34,485
I think we are linked.

500
00:51:34,652 --> 00:51:37,196
It's more than just a story to me too.

501
00:51:37,363 --> 00:51:39,865
I actually want to believe it.

502
00:51:41,033 --> 00:51:42,743
Goodbye, Mr. Heep.

503
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:01,679
You have saved my life again.

504
00:52:03,472 --> 00:52:05,641
You made that room.

505
00:52:08,102 --> 00:52:12,106
The cracks that I saw. Is that room
supposed to collapse eventually?

506
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:15,734
I'm not allowed to speak
of The Blue World.

507
00:52:15,901 --> 00:52:18,612
Well, the door needs a little work.

508
00:52:21,073 --> 00:52:24,743
I noticed that you took things
from the apartment...

509
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:27,454
...that people left around the pool.

510
00:52:28,789 --> 00:52:33,627
That's how I saw you.
You were taking something off of a chair.

511
00:52:40,384 --> 00:52:44,013
I think I might know why
the scrunt needs to get you so bad.

512
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,891
Why did he break the rules tonight?

513
00:52:47,057 --> 00:52:51,061
As it turns out,
I think that you're someone...

514
00:52:51,479 --> 00:52:55,107
...very important to everyone.

515
00:53:34,146 --> 00:53:37,858
I tried to tell them about you.
I don't know if I did the right thing.

516
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,861
I'm not sure how they're gonna react.

517
00:53:41,028 --> 00:53:42,988
I trust you.

518
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,033
I believe you are here to protect me.

519
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:52,206
Is the Kii working?

520
00:53:52,373 --> 00:53:54,416
Yes, thank you.

521
00:53:55,376 --> 00:53:58,337
If it is true that I am...

522
00:53:58,504 --> 00:54:00,840
He will keep coming after me.

523
00:54:01,006 --> 00:54:03,801
I will not be safe until...

524
00:54:03,968 --> 00:54:06,303
Until Tartutic comes.

525
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:23,487
My mother said she saw a ghost once,
in the basement.

526
00:54:23,654 --> 00:54:26,282
I was the only one who believed her.

527
00:54:26,448 --> 00:54:28,909
She's not an apparition, Anna.

528
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:32,997
I don't know who you are...

529
00:54:34,206 --> 00:54:36,667
...but you did something to me.

530
00:54:38,919 --> 00:54:40,838
My thoughts.

531
00:54:44,925 --> 00:54:47,428
Everything became clearer.

532
00:54:48,596 --> 00:54:52,766
The fears that were muddling
my thoughts just went away.

533
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:55,686
I can hear myself.

534
00:54:58,105 --> 00:55:00,733
Do you wish to know your future?

535
00:55:06,614 --> 00:55:09,825
A boy in the Midwest of this land...

536
00:55:09,992 --> 00:55:14,413
...will grow up in a home where your book
will be on the shelf and spoken of often.

537
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,791
He will grow up
with these ideas in his head.

538
00:55:18,209 --> 00:55:21,295
He will grow into a great orator.

539
00:55:21,879 --> 00:55:24,840
He will speak and his words
will be heard throughout this land...

540
00:55:25,007 --> 00:55:27,301
...and throughout the world.

541
00:55:28,093 --> 00:55:32,389
This boy will become
leader of this country...

542
00:55:32,556 --> 00:55:35,434
...and begin a movement
of great change.

543
00:55:36,185 --> 00:55:39,230
He will speak of you and your words.

544
00:55:39,939 --> 00:55:43,818
Your book will be the seeds
of many of his great thoughts.

545
00:55:45,986 --> 00:55:48,656
It will be the seeds of change.

546
00:55:51,242 --> 00:55:53,285
The Cookbook?

547
00:56:01,335 --> 00:56:04,171
One, two, three.

548
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:40,040
Oh, jeez.

549
00:56:48,841 --> 00:56:53,888
Could you tell her that I was interested
in hearing more of the story?

550
00:57:26,504 --> 00:57:29,548
Tell her it's a beautiful story.

551
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:34,220
Are there... Are there any parts
that might be good to hear?

552
00:57:57,868 --> 00:57:59,912
- How is she?
- The medicine's helping her.

553
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,998
I told her to stay under the shower.
She does better with water.

554
00:58:03,165 --> 00:58:06,210
I need to talk with her.
And Vick should be there too.

555
00:58:07,711 --> 00:58:12,049
I told them to wait right outside.
I'll tell them what you have to say.

556
00:58:12,842 --> 00:58:16,428
Tell her I know that she is not allowed
to tell about her world...

557
00:58:16,595 --> 00:58:20,891
...but maybe I could ask some questions,
and she can just say if it's right or wrong.

558
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,604
Know what I did when I was little and me
and my girlfriends would get in trouble?

559
00:58:25,771 --> 00:58:27,940
My mom always wanted to know
what happened...

560
00:58:28,107 --> 00:58:30,317
...but I was like,
"I can't tell on my friends."

561
00:58:30,484 --> 00:58:34,905
So she came up with this way
of me telling her things without talking.

562
00:58:35,072 --> 00:58:39,118
She would say, "Touch your ear
or something if the answer is yes."

563
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:41,829
So I would, and then
she would know certain things...

564
00:58:41,996 --> 00:58:44,999
...but I didn't really feel
like I told on my friends.

565
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:49,712
It was cheating, I know,
but made me feel better.

566
00:58:50,296 --> 00:58:51,422
We're ready.

567
00:58:54,508 --> 00:58:57,636
So in this bedtime story...

568
00:58:57,803 --> 00:59:00,973
...the narf has come
to a preordained place.

569
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,685
She must leave from the same spot.

570
00:59:04,852 --> 00:59:07,605
This eagle, the Great Eatlon,
coming to take her back...

571
00:59:07,771 --> 00:59:09,315
...is really very important.

572
00:59:09,482 --> 00:59:11,484
And here's the good stuff.

573
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:15,571
There are humans
with powers that can help her.

574
00:59:15,738 --> 00:59:18,282
And these people
have been unconsciously drawn...

575
00:59:18,449 --> 00:59:20,618
...to live near the vessel.

576
00:59:20,784 --> 00:59:23,329
Now, these humans
don't know who they are...

577
00:59:23,496 --> 00:59:26,707
...and they always
appear in the story earlier.

578
00:59:26,874 --> 00:59:29,668
Are there humans with powers
that can help you...

579
00:59:29,835 --> 00:59:31,420
...but don't know who they are?

580
00:59:32,963 --> 00:59:34,006
That's a yes!

581
00:59:36,133 --> 00:59:40,804
They've got weird names:
A Symbolist, a Guardian and a Guild.

582
00:59:40,971 --> 00:59:42,139
Ask her if that's right.

583
00:59:45,392 --> 00:59:47,520
You want something.

584
00:59:48,354 --> 00:59:51,065
One of them. Vick.

585
00:59:51,232 --> 00:59:55,945
Mr. Heep. Mr. Heep is one of them.

586
00:59:57,196 --> 00:59:59,990
Which one? Guild, Guardian?

587
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:04,411
She thinks Mr. Heep is the Guardian.

588
01:00:05,996 --> 01:00:09,166
I was told that there's a Symbolist...

589
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:12,711
...an interpreter who can read signs
in clouds and other forms.

590
01:00:12,878 --> 01:00:15,214
He will interpret messages...

591
01:00:16,215 --> 01:00:19,009
...from the universe
if problems should arise.

592
01:00:19,176 --> 01:00:22,304
Do you know who the Symbolist
or Interpreter is?

593
01:00:22,763 --> 01:00:24,723
That's a no.

594
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:28,894
And I was told that there is a Guild...

595
01:00:29,061 --> 01:00:31,856
...whose many hands
will combine to help.

596
01:00:32,022 --> 01:00:33,941
Does she know who they are?

597
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:36,318
There is a Guild or something.

598
01:00:36,485 --> 01:00:39,280
They're supposed to help
with their hands.

599
01:00:39,989 --> 01:00:41,907
That's another no.

600
01:00:43,576 --> 01:00:44,910
All right, there's one other.

601
01:00:45,077 --> 01:00:48,706
I don't know if it's worth mentioning.
It's not in the stories all the time.

602
01:00:48,873 --> 01:00:52,376
It's a human, usually a female...

603
01:00:52,543 --> 01:00:54,253
...so full of hope...

604
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:59,258
...that they can awaken
the life force in all things.

605
01:00:59,425 --> 01:01:01,594
Now, that one is called the Healer.

606
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,929
And you can tell
that they're in the story...

607
01:01:04,096 --> 01:01:07,057
...because butterflies
are drawn to the Healer.

608
01:01:08,976 --> 01:01:11,687
- Butterflies.
- The last one's a Healer.

609
01:01:11,854 --> 01:01:14,440
You don't know
any of these people, do you?

610
01:01:20,112 --> 01:01:23,282
Reading? A book?

611
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:25,367
Learning.

612
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:29,371
She thinks it has to be learned.

613
01:01:29,538 --> 01:01:31,832
Is the eagle
going to come back for her?

614
01:01:35,211 --> 01:01:36,670
Only one last time.

615
01:01:37,213 --> 01:01:39,340
Mr. Heep,
you know the people in this building.

616
01:01:39,507 --> 01:01:41,133
You have to find them.

617
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:50,142
What is it?

618
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:52,520
You know these walls are paper-thin?

619
01:01:52,686 --> 01:01:56,065
I can hear all that bloody noise
downstairs like they were in my kitchen.

620
01:01:56,232 --> 01:01:58,526
Can you do anything about that?

621
01:02:00,444 --> 01:02:02,196
Of course not.

622
01:02:02,822 --> 01:02:06,951
- What is it you want, anyway?
- Well, I had a question.

623
01:02:07,117 --> 01:02:11,121
You're an expert on p... P... Plots, right?

624
01:02:11,288 --> 01:02:16,085
You know who's gonna do what in a book
or a movie even at the beginning, yes?

625
01:02:16,252 --> 01:02:19,630
There is no originality left in the world,
Mr. Heep.

626
01:02:19,797 --> 01:02:21,841
That is a sad fact I've come to live with.

627
01:02:22,007 --> 01:02:26,554
Well, if there was a mystery...

628
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,099
...and a guy had to figure out
who some people were...

629
01:02:30,266 --> 01:02:33,519
...like he had to find a symbol guy...

630
01:02:33,686 --> 01:02:36,856
...someone who can
figure out messages...

631
01:02:37,022 --> 01:02:42,945
...and a guild of people who are going
to be important at the end as a group.

632
01:02:43,445 --> 01:02:45,823
How would you figure that out?

633
01:02:47,074 --> 01:02:49,910
The symbol person should be simple.

634
01:02:50,327 --> 01:02:53,831
Look for any character
who is doing something mundane...

635
01:02:53,998 --> 01:02:55,708
...but required analysis.

636
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:59,253
Someone who was skilled at puzzles.

637
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,714
Joey, you can't have cereal for lunch.

638
01:03:01,881 --> 01:03:05,968
This picture on the cereal box
is supposed to make you feel happy.

639
01:03:06,385 --> 01:03:10,389
I feel sad, like that time
you forgot to pick me up at school.

640
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:16,145
Joey, Mr. Heep appears disquieted.
Can you give us a moment alone?

641
01:03:16,896 --> 01:03:18,814
Sure, Dad.

642
01:03:20,399 --> 01:03:22,276
As for the guild...

643
01:03:22,443 --> 01:03:25,571
...Iook for any group of characters
that are always seen together...

644
01:03:25,738 --> 01:03:28,616
...and have seemingly irrelevant
and tedious dialogue...

645
01:03:28,782 --> 01:03:31,076
...that seems to regurgitate forever.

646
01:03:31,243 --> 01:03:34,622
And you just sit around
and talk about nothing?

647
01:03:34,788 --> 01:03:37,666
Oh, we talk about serious issues.

648
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:39,585
On occasion.

649
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:46,926
We talked about Martin Luther King
at the Tequila Hut Tuesday night.

650
01:03:48,928 --> 01:03:50,304
You talked about that?

651
01:03:50,471 --> 01:03:53,432
This is the writer's way
of establishing characters...

652
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,477
...who will be important
further in the story.

653
01:03:56,852 --> 01:03:59,980
Is there anything further
I can assist you with during my naptime?

654
01:04:00,147 --> 01:04:03,984
No. No, Mr. Farber. Thank you.

655
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:22,461
Story, these young men are the Guild.

656
01:04:22,628 --> 01:04:25,673
And Mr. Dury... Mr. Dury?

657
01:04:27,007 --> 01:04:29,718
Mr. Dury is the Interpreter.

658
01:04:31,053 --> 01:04:34,932
And there's one other person.
Mrs. Bell, could you come in here, please?

659
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:39,395
This is Mrs. Bell, the Healer.

660
01:04:40,771 --> 01:04:43,941
Story wants to go home and she can't.

661
01:04:44,108 --> 01:04:46,652
Tomorrow night is her last chance.

662
01:04:47,486 --> 01:04:49,697
Mr. Dury, please step forward.

663
01:04:49,864 --> 01:04:54,285
- Mr. Heep, you're not stuttering.
- Yes, I know. I know. It's only around her.

664
01:04:57,204 --> 01:05:01,292
Now, the Interpreter will tell us what
to do if something should go wrong.

665
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:05,421
He will use an instrument
specific to him...

666
01:05:05,588 --> 01:05:07,464
...to interpret.

667
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:10,843
- Try it, Mr. Dury.
- I don't...

668
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,512
Let's just see what happens.

669
01:05:14,096 --> 01:05:17,099
I think that there's
a message in there for us.

670
01:05:21,687 --> 01:05:26,650
Well, nine letters across
is the word "essential."

671
01:05:28,777 --> 01:05:31,530
And it touches...

672
01:05:32,031 --> 01:05:36,619
...27 down, which is "scheme."

673
01:05:36,785 --> 01:05:39,079
- Essential scheme.
- Yes.

674
01:05:39,246 --> 01:05:42,541
Now, those were the first two words
that I deciphered in this puzzle...

675
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:46,086
...and I thought that was...
Well, I thought that was weird.

676
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,968
There's a word that seems
out of place to me.

677
01:05:53,135 --> 01:05:56,722
- Yes.
- It's a six-letter word for "get-together."

678
01:05:56,889 --> 01:05:58,766
- "Soiree."
- Soiree.

679
01:05:59,517 --> 01:06:02,561
Soiree could mean "party." How
could a...? How does a party help us?

680
01:06:02,728 --> 01:06:05,523
Well, I guess I thought that, you know...

681
01:06:05,689 --> 01:06:10,861
...a party is interesting because
this thing out there is an animal...

682
01:06:11,028 --> 01:06:13,614
...and it probably has
a very keen sense of smell.

683
01:06:13,781 --> 01:06:17,618
- Why is everyone staring at me?
- Go on. Go on, Mr. Dury. Go on.

684
01:06:17,785 --> 01:06:21,539
Humans have a pungent smell
to animals...

685
01:06:21,705 --> 01:06:25,084
...so I thought that maybe everyone
gathered together would confuse him...

686
01:06:25,251 --> 01:06:29,004
...and he wouldn't be able to distinguish
her from amongst all of us.

687
01:06:29,171 --> 01:06:30,256
Does that sound right?

688
01:06:30,422 --> 01:06:33,050
He's hearing the voice of God
through a crossword puzzle.

689
01:06:33,217 --> 01:06:36,262
- We're just playing here, right?
- No. Wait, wait.

690
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:41,016
See, I don't think that the Great Eatlon...

691
01:06:41,183 --> 01:06:44,979
...will land in the presence
of beings not from its world.

692
01:06:45,312 --> 01:06:48,232
She didn't want me to watch
when the eagle came the first time.

693
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:50,526
That's before she knew
that I was the Guardian.

694
01:06:50,693 --> 01:06:52,444
Would I be able to watch now?

695
01:06:54,238 --> 01:06:57,616
But there will be...
There'll be hundreds of people at a party.

696
01:06:57,783 --> 01:07:01,453
It won't work. It won't work. See if
there's anything else in there, Mr. Dury.

697
01:07:02,997 --> 01:07:06,125
This word did give me great difficulty,
and then it came to me.

698
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:09,795
- "Sonorous."
- Sonorous, sonorous.

699
01:07:09,962 --> 01:07:12,923
It could mean music, a band.

700
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:17,511
Maybe we gather everyone inside
at the last minute to hear a band...

701
01:07:17,678 --> 01:07:21,140
...and we who are of the world
stay with her...

702
01:07:21,307 --> 01:07:25,102
...to help her with that thing and...

703
01:07:25,269 --> 01:07:27,021
Until she's taken.

704
01:07:28,105 --> 01:07:29,815
He's a prophet.

705
01:07:29,982 --> 01:07:33,152
We're all just seeing what we want to.
I just made all that up.

706
01:07:33,319 --> 01:07:36,030
No, I think that it worked.
I think that it worked.

707
01:07:36,197 --> 01:07:38,908
That is why they're the Guild.

708
01:07:39,074 --> 01:07:43,120
I think they're supposed
to use their hands to throw us a party.

709
01:07:43,287 --> 01:07:45,748
- Is he serious?
- We're gonna throw a party.

710
01:07:46,457 --> 01:07:50,002
- Huge party. We are serious.
- Tell them...

711
01:07:50,169 --> 01:07:53,297
Anything you can do for us,
all right? Tables...

712
01:07:53,464 --> 01:07:57,009
We definitely need a band. It's like
the most important thing. Oh, my God.

713
01:08:03,849 --> 01:08:06,727
You don't think this is gonna work,
do you?

714
01:08:08,521 --> 01:08:10,523
I'm nervous too.

715
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,109
You being out there tomorrow night.

716
01:08:14,568 --> 01:08:17,780
Me not knowing what to do
as the Guardian.

717
01:08:20,074 --> 01:08:24,203
Think I can go out there tonight
and maybe face that thing without you?

718
01:08:25,412 --> 01:08:27,748
Get a little practice with him?

719
01:08:27,915 --> 01:08:29,875
Scare him, maybe?

720
01:08:30,042 --> 01:08:32,044
Show him who's boss?

721
01:08:35,673 --> 01:08:38,092
I know you wanna get home.

722
01:08:47,351 --> 01:08:49,478
You will need a mirror.

723
01:08:50,312 --> 01:08:52,773
Can you hear me? I'm here.

724
01:08:53,232 --> 01:08:55,526
Peer over your shoulder carefully.

725
01:08:55,693 --> 01:09:00,406
It is only through a mirror that one can
see the eyes of a scrunt in the grass.

726
01:09:00,573 --> 01:09:05,452
It will appear to you
as two red spots in the darkness.

727
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:09,540
Yeah, l... I don 't... I...

728
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:12,668
Wait.

729
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:15,045
I see him.

730
01:09:18,174 --> 01:09:20,843
The Guardian has instincts
of when the scrunt will attack.

731
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:23,846
He is a great weapon against him.

732
01:09:24,513 --> 01:09:28,684
You should walk backwards
towards him.

733
01:09:28,851 --> 01:09:31,937
When you are close enough
to be certain of his position...

734
01:09:32,104 --> 01:09:34,690
...turn and face the hidden scrunt.

735
01:09:39,278 --> 01:09:41,238
I'm facing him.

736
01:09:42,364 --> 01:09:44,325
I am scared.

737
01:09:44,783 --> 01:09:47,578
It is about to get very dangerous.

738
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:49,663
Okay.

739
01:09:51,457 --> 01:09:53,250
I'm ready.

740
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:59,298
You must invoke the ancient words
"Nef Ra Mora."

741
01:09:59,465 --> 01:10:04,762
It is a command to rise
and a challenge to fight.

742
01:10:13,854 --> 01:10:15,731
What is happening?

743
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,819
He's rising out of the grass.

744
01:10:21,278 --> 01:10:24,615
His legs are bending and coiling...

745
01:10:25,491 --> 01:10:27,243
...underneath him.

746
01:10:27,535 --> 01:10:31,705
Oh, my God. Oh, my... Oh, no.

747
01:10:32,414 --> 01:10:33,874
He's standing in front of me.

748
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:35,751
The Guardian can hypnotize a scrunt.

749
01:10:35,918 --> 01:10:38,504
If the Guardian looks directly
into the scrunt's eyes...

750
01:10:38,671 --> 01:10:42,299
...it will be compelled to stay frozen
or move backwards.

751
01:10:42,842 --> 01:10:45,678
What is the J.G. Scrunt's reaction?
Is he frightened?

752
01:10:45,845 --> 01:10:47,346
I'm not sure.

753
01:10:47,513 --> 01:10:49,640
- Look into his eyes.
- I am.

754
01:10:49,807 --> 01:10:52,393
- Is he moving away?
- No.

755
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,687
The Guardian can control his mind.

756
01:10:54,854 --> 01:10:57,731
The J.G. Scrunt will not
be able to attack.

757
01:10:58,023 --> 01:11:02,695
- Okay.
- You must look into his eyes.

758
01:11:02,862 --> 01:11:04,613
I think something's wrong.

759
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:06,866
He's stepping forward.

760
01:11:07,491 --> 01:11:09,076
He's stepping forward?

761
01:11:09,243 --> 01:11:11,245
Something's wrong!

762
01:11:13,664 --> 01:11:16,208
Cleveland, run!

763
01:11:22,131 --> 01:11:25,467
What is it you are doing?

764
01:11:27,052 --> 01:11:28,804
Hey there.

765
01:11:30,639 --> 01:11:35,686
Anything I can do for you there,
Mr. F... F... F... Farber?

766
01:11:36,145 --> 01:11:37,646
No.

767
01:11:44,612 --> 01:11:48,407
So how was the m... Movie?

768
01:11:48,574 --> 01:11:50,242
- Sucked.
- Oh, what a... What a shame.

769
01:11:50,409 --> 01:11:54,079
Characters were walking around
saying their thoughts out loud.

770
01:11:54,246 --> 01:11:55,831
Who does that?

771
01:11:55,998 --> 01:11:57,249
And a typical romance...

772
01:11:57,416 --> 01:12:01,629
...where the couple finally tell each other
they love one another in the rain.

773
01:12:02,338 --> 01:12:06,425
Why does everyone like to stand around
and talk in the rain in movies?

774
01:12:07,009 --> 01:12:09,178
Well, maybe...

775
01:12:09,595 --> 01:12:13,808
Maybe it's a metaphor for purification,
starting new.

776
01:12:14,934 --> 01:12:17,770
No. It's not.

777
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:20,189
Are you okay?

778
01:12:21,941 --> 01:12:25,069
He'll choose to move
only when no one is looking.

779
01:12:25,236 --> 01:12:27,363
They're masters of hiding.

780
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:31,450
A scrunt will hide unless
he cannot hide in his environment.

781
01:12:31,617 --> 01:12:34,662
If a tenant hadn't walked by...

782
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:37,456
...I'd have been eaten alive.

783
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:41,836
I had no powers over him.

784
01:12:42,002 --> 01:12:44,421
You are not the Guardian.

785
01:12:45,923 --> 01:12:48,384
I do not understand.

786
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,184
I cannot protect you.

787
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,437
Where are the Tartutic?

788
01:13:00,604 --> 01:13:02,982
Why isn't he being punished?

789
01:13:03,774 --> 01:13:06,277
Where is the justice?

790
01:13:25,087 --> 01:13:27,548
How come you don't ask
about bedtime story anymore?

791
01:13:31,844 --> 01:13:33,512
I've been busy.

792
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:42,229
You... You coming to the party tonight?

793
01:13:42,605 --> 01:13:44,440
I have to study.

794
01:13:44,607 --> 01:13:46,442
Bye, Mr. Heep.

795
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:56,285
Mr. Leeds,
did you hear about the p... Party?

796
01:14:00,748 --> 01:14:01,999
You coming?

797
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:04,043
- A picture here
of the enemy they're...

798
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:06,545
Does man deserve to be saved,
Mr. Heep?

799
01:14:06,712 --> 01:14:08,839
- What?
- Man.

800
01:14:12,343 --> 01:14:13,844
Yes.

801
01:14:14,303 --> 01:14:16,096
That's not the answer I expected.

802
01:14:16,263 --> 01:14:19,892
Why'd you a... Ask me that?

803
01:14:20,226 --> 01:14:22,436
I know about your family.

804
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:25,898
I looked you up
when you started working here.

805
01:14:26,649 --> 01:14:28,943
I know someone killed them.

806
01:14:29,109 --> 01:14:33,614
But you can't give up.
You can't hide here, son.

807
01:14:35,157 --> 01:14:36,700
I know.

808
01:14:36,867 --> 01:14:39,286
You don't wanna become like me.

809
01:14:40,538 --> 01:14:44,458
By the way, your invitation would sound
more real if it had the guy's name on it.

810
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:47,711
There's something strange going on
around this building.

811
01:14:47,878 --> 01:14:49,755
Don't think I haven't noticed.

812
01:14:56,971 --> 01:14:58,639
It is finished?

813
01:15:01,767 --> 01:15:04,311
You can see things in the future?

814
01:15:04,478 --> 01:15:06,480
Some things.

815
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:09,441
I have a question to ask you.

816
01:15:10,276 --> 01:15:13,571
I will do my best to answer it.

817
01:15:13,737 --> 01:15:15,948
You'll tell me the truth, right?

818
01:15:17,366 --> 01:15:18,909
Yes.

819
01:15:19,952 --> 01:15:23,497
Change doesn't happen the way
you say it's gonna happen...

820
01:15:23,664 --> 01:15:27,293
...without dramatic events
that accelerate thinking.

821
01:15:28,294 --> 01:15:29,587
I wrote this thing.

822
01:15:29,753 --> 01:15:33,424
It might take decades or longer
to create a reaction...

823
01:15:33,883 --> 01:15:36,927
...before it anchors
in the consciousness.

824
01:15:37,595 --> 01:15:41,265
That's not the type of change
you're telling me is gonna happen, right?

825
01:15:43,058 --> 01:15:46,061
I was wondering
why he didn't meet me...

826
01:15:47,188 --> 01:15:49,732
...this leader who's just a boy.

827
01:15:50,316 --> 01:15:54,862
If he was so inspired by my words,
why didn't he try to meet me?

828
01:15:56,113 --> 01:16:00,159
There's a lot of things in The Cookbook
people won't like to hear.

829
01:16:02,661 --> 01:16:07,958
I'm not anything, you know?
I don't think I'm anything special.

830
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:11,295
So I started thinking,
"How is this gonna happen?

831
01:16:11,462 --> 01:16:15,424
Why are people gonna suddenly
take me seriously?

832
01:16:16,342 --> 01:16:18,636
And why didn't he meet me?"

833
01:16:21,847 --> 01:16:24,391
And I thought of how it could happen.

834
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:29,814
Story, I wanted to ask you,
is something gonna happen to me?

835
01:16:31,023 --> 01:16:34,401
Is someone gonna kill me
because I write this?

836
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,529
Yes.

837
01:16:37,029 --> 01:16:40,699
Man thinks they're each alone
in this world.

838
01:16:40,866 --> 01:16:43,077
It is not true.

839
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:45,996
You are all connected.

840
01:16:46,539 --> 01:16:50,209
One act can one day affect all.

841
01:16:55,381 --> 01:16:58,801
What are you guys whispering about?

842
01:16:58,968 --> 01:17:02,012
Is he trying to get you to tell him
how many kids he's gonna have?

843
01:17:02,179 --> 01:17:05,266
I told him eight, all bratty boys.

844
01:17:05,432 --> 01:17:08,561
I asked her if she knew the name
of the deaf, dumb and blind guy...

845
01:17:08,727 --> 01:17:10,396
...that's gonna marry you.

846
01:17:10,563 --> 01:17:13,732
Very funny, Herb.

847
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:26,412
Okay.

848
01:17:28,122 --> 01:17:30,499
Don't tell my sister.

849
01:18:01,614 --> 01:18:05,493
Hi. I'm Mr. Farber.

850
01:18:07,453 --> 01:18:09,914
I wanted to thank you.

851
01:18:10,372 --> 01:18:15,419
I was completely surprised by all of this.

852
01:18:15,878 --> 01:18:19,965
I was expecting some kind of greeting,
of course.

853
01:18:21,383 --> 01:18:24,386
But this is beyond my expectations.

854
01:18:26,806 --> 01:18:28,891
I'm 13B.

855
01:18:29,767 --> 01:18:32,978
- Oh, yeah. How you doing? What's up?
- Oh, yeah. Good for you.

856
01:18:34,605 --> 01:18:37,608
I know of your future, Cleveland.

857
01:18:38,108 --> 01:18:40,194
Do you wanna hear it?

858
01:18:40,361 --> 01:18:41,821
No.

859
01:18:44,448 --> 01:18:48,160
Tell me what happens
when the eagle takes you back.

860
01:18:48,577 --> 01:18:51,705
It is only what I have been told
by others.

861
01:18:52,164 --> 01:18:57,503
They tell us the world will line up
and reveal we are on the right path...

862
01:18:57,670 --> 01:19:00,047
...that the universe will give us signs.

863
01:19:00,881 --> 01:19:03,133
The Tartutic could have not come yet.

864
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,679
I can still sense
the scrunt's presence near.

865
01:19:07,179 --> 01:19:12,309
You have to believe
that this all makes sense somehow.

866
01:19:15,688 --> 01:19:18,524
I don't know why I'm the Madam Narf.

867
01:19:18,691 --> 01:19:23,779
I'm not special. I'm clumsy.
They make fun of me.

868
01:19:23,946 --> 01:19:26,365
I don't know how to lead.

869
01:19:28,075 --> 01:19:32,121
Do you get sick
every time you break a rule?

870
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:36,167
Every time that you tell me
something that you shouldn't?

871
01:19:39,336 --> 01:19:41,922
There's a storm coming.

872
01:19:45,634 --> 01:19:49,722
- I am scared.
- It's okay to be scared.

873
01:19:50,055 --> 01:19:52,641
I do not have courage.

874
01:19:53,309 --> 01:19:55,436
I do not want to be a Madam Narf.

875
01:19:55,603 --> 01:19:57,938
You do what you think is right.

876
01:19:58,105 --> 01:20:00,566
You are very brave.

877
01:20:01,442 --> 01:20:04,862
You were always meant to lead, Story.

878
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:09,783
Cleveland...

879
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,829
...the Great Eatlon is coming.

880
01:21:26,443 --> 01:21:27,862
Okay.

881
01:21:31,532 --> 01:21:33,826
I'm glad you read my journal.

882
01:21:34,952 --> 01:21:38,664
Don't worry. We're all watching you.

883
01:22:12,698 --> 01:22:15,784
Oh, come on.
The music should have started already.

884
01:22:17,495 --> 01:22:20,122
Do not leave this spot.

885
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:24,960
- Yo, come on.
- Hey.

886
01:22:33,552 --> 01:22:35,763
Find a mirror.

887
01:23:29,775 --> 01:23:32,987
Why hasn't the m... Music started?

888
01:23:33,154 --> 01:23:36,615
It's been working smooth.
We've been playing with it all night.

889
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:40,244
You used up the battery.

890
01:23:40,494 --> 01:23:42,288
Wave to him.

891
01:23:51,922 --> 01:23:54,216
They told her that the universe
would line up...

892
01:23:54,383 --> 01:23:58,304
...and reveal that we're
on the right p... Path.

893
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:00,890
Why isn't this working?

894
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:30,252
Okay.

895
01:24:43,599 --> 01:24:47,019
Sometimes animals just look dead.

896
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:55,861
Something went wrong.
They took her inside, up by the pool.

897
01:25:25,891 --> 01:25:28,853
It is not time for you to go.

898
01:25:31,147 --> 01:25:35,693
It is not time for you to go.

899
01:25:43,242 --> 01:25:46,162
Isn't this supposed to work?

900
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:54,044
Fourteen across.

901
01:25:56,088 --> 01:25:57,715
No. No.

902
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,472
I don't know.

903
01:26:06,015 --> 01:26:07,808
I don't know.

904
01:26:11,228 --> 01:26:15,774
This world is about finding
your purpose, right?

905
01:26:15,941 --> 01:26:20,279
And the only way to do that is to find
your own voice. You told us that.

906
01:26:20,779 --> 01:26:24,283
I don't feel like an Interpreter.

907
01:26:24,867 --> 01:26:28,120
Is it possible that that isn't my purpose?

908
01:26:29,455 --> 01:26:33,751
I mean, I don't see anything
in these words, and I didn't before.

909
01:26:36,545 --> 01:26:39,131
And finding one's purpose
is a profound thing.

910
01:26:39,298 --> 01:26:42,301
Sometimes it isn't always
what it seems.

911
01:26:45,805 --> 01:26:47,765
What if these young men
are not the Guild?

912
01:26:47,932 --> 01:26:49,517
Look at what happened at the party.

913
01:26:49,683 --> 01:26:52,102
These things haven't seemed right
from the beginning.

914
01:26:52,269 --> 01:26:55,898
Why are you so certain that I am
the Interpreter and they are the Guild?

915
01:27:00,611 --> 01:27:03,155
He was so sure.

916
01:27:03,322 --> 01:27:04,740
What?

917
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:06,867
I...

918
01:27:08,244 --> 01:27:10,538
...asked someone.

919
01:27:10,704 --> 01:27:12,957
He acted like he knew.

920
01:27:13,123 --> 01:27:15,084
What kind of person
would be so arrogant...

921
01:27:15,251 --> 01:27:18,003
...to presume to know the intention
of another human being?

922
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:20,256
Who put this young girl's life
in jeopardy?

923
01:27:27,388 --> 01:27:29,140
Hello?

924
01:27:36,522 --> 01:27:39,859
Is the bathroom on this level working?

925
01:27:42,194 --> 01:27:44,488
A dog inside the building.

926
01:27:44,655 --> 01:27:47,616
Go. Shoo!

927
01:27:52,955 --> 01:27:54,707
Why, you're not a dog at all.

928
01:27:58,419 --> 01:28:00,087
My God.

929
01:28:00,713 --> 01:28:03,799
This is like a moment
from a horror movie.

930
01:28:05,551 --> 01:28:08,762
It is precisely the moment
where the mutation or beast...

931
01:28:08,929 --> 01:28:12,600
...will attempt to kill
an unlikable side character.

932
01:28:12,766 --> 01:28:16,937
But in stories where there
has been no prior cursing, nudity...

933
01:28:17,104 --> 01:28:20,316
...killing or death,
such as in a family film...

934
01:28:20,483 --> 01:28:24,403
...the unlikable character
will narrowly escape his encounter...

935
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:26,947
...and be referenced again
later in the story...

936
01:28:27,114 --> 01:28:30,284
...having learned valuable lessons.

937
01:28:30,868 --> 01:28:32,745
He may even be given
a humorous moment...

938
01:28:32,912 --> 01:28:35,956
...to allow the audience
to feel good about him.

939
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:41,170
This is where I turn to run.

940
01:28:41,337 --> 01:28:43,756
You will leap for me.

941
01:28:43,923 --> 01:28:45,925
I will shut the door.

942
01:28:46,091 --> 01:28:50,596
And you will land
a fraction of a second too late.

943
01:28:53,849 --> 01:28:55,684
Why would they lie to her
about Tartutic?

944
01:28:55,851 --> 01:28:59,355
These cannot just be fairy tales
they tell to make the narfs risk their lives.

945
01:28:59,522 --> 01:29:00,981
This has gotta be about faith.

946
01:29:01,148 --> 01:29:04,193
Her world works by different rules
than ours. She may not be dead.

947
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:07,321
- We need to be told what to do.
- We need to find the Interpreter.

948
01:29:07,488 --> 01:29:10,032
How are we suddenly
going to realize someone's purpose?

949
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:13,619
This is someone doing something ancient.
An ancient thing in modern times.

950
01:29:13,786 --> 01:29:16,622
It could be someone who sees purity
in what we see as mundane.

951
01:29:16,789 --> 01:29:18,791
Sees the voice of God
in the ordinary.

952
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:21,126
He is someone who sees meaning
in the ordinary.

953
01:29:21,293 --> 01:29:24,797
Does anyone have any idea
who this is?

954
01:29:26,966 --> 01:29:28,509
My God.

955
01:29:30,636 --> 01:29:32,096
I do.

956
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:35,391
There is a message.

957
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:40,479
There is a ceremony to be done.

958
01:29:40,646 --> 01:29:42,940
You're doing great, Joey.

959
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:49,405
The hands of the Guild will be needed,
plus two others.

960
01:29:49,572 --> 01:29:52,408
Joey, who is the Guild?

961
01:29:54,785 --> 01:29:58,164
It is a ceremony of seven sisters.

962
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:00,875
Sisters? The Guild is women?

963
01:30:02,168 --> 01:30:05,171
They will touch together
with their hearts as one...

964
01:30:05,337 --> 01:30:07,798
...to bring strength to the moment.

965
01:30:07,965 --> 01:30:09,800
Nice, Joey.

966
01:30:12,344 --> 01:30:15,181
You will need a man
who has no secrets...

967
01:30:15,347 --> 01:30:19,143
...and one whose opinion
is highly respected as witnesses.

968
01:30:20,561 --> 01:30:25,357
All must hurry.
This will all be over in moments.

969
01:30:55,012 --> 01:30:57,515
Mr. Perez de la Torre.

970
01:30:58,182 --> 01:31:03,562
I need to speak with your
f... F... F... F... Five daughters.

971
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:12,238
Honey? Honey,
there's some people here to see you.

972
01:31:19,286 --> 01:31:20,788
Sweetheart?

973
01:31:22,414 --> 01:31:24,834
He's probably rinsing his mouth.

974
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,919
He's got terrible breath.

975
01:31:27,086 --> 01:31:29,630
Don't tell him I told you.

976
01:31:44,019 --> 01:31:47,982
- Huge explosions
right in the very heart of the capital.

977
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:53,404
Several explosions, I felt at least four
very close to the center of the city.

978
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:03,474
I think we have everybody.

979
01:33:06,352 --> 01:33:10,397
A man who has no secrets...

980
01:33:10,564 --> 01:33:16,028
...and one whose opinion
I greatly respect.

981
01:33:16,195 --> 01:33:20,366
They will be w... W... Witnesses.

982
01:33:20,533 --> 01:33:24,912
Will the Guild please come forward?

983
01:33:29,542 --> 01:33:31,126
Yeah.

984
01:33:32,336 --> 01:33:34,338
And you make seven.

985
01:33:35,047 --> 01:33:37,049
Seven sisters.

986
01:33:39,552 --> 01:33:41,470
Come, come.

987
01:33:43,806 --> 01:33:45,307
Yeah.

988
01:33:46,058 --> 01:33:48,352
Everything's right now.

989
01:33:53,107 --> 01:33:55,359
Come back to us now.

990
01:33:56,485 --> 01:34:00,656
Come back to us now, honey.
Come back to us.

991
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:08,789
I can't believe it.

992
01:34:08,956 --> 01:34:12,793
This is crazy. This woman
is probably dying as we're talking.

993
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,587
She needs to get to a hospital.

994
01:34:14,753 --> 01:34:18,966
This is not right. We can't just stand here
playing make-believe.

995
01:34:19,133 --> 01:34:21,927
I wanted to believe more than most.

996
01:34:22,511 --> 01:34:24,930
I wanna be like a child again.

997
01:34:25,431 --> 01:34:28,434
I needed to believe there's more
than this awfulness around us...

998
01:34:28,601 --> 01:34:30,311
...but at some point we have to stop.

999
01:34:30,478 --> 01:34:35,649
Mr. Leeds, it is time to prove
some stories are real.

1000
01:34:36,734 --> 01:34:38,777
I read it wrong.

1001
01:34:43,699 --> 01:34:45,451
It was my first time.

1002
01:34:45,618 --> 01:34:48,621
I thought it said, "She will lead
a ceremony of seven sisters...

1003
01:34:48,787 --> 01:34:51,123
...to bring strength to the moment."

1004
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:55,503
I looked at it again. It says "he."

1005
01:34:55,669 --> 01:35:01,467
"He will lead a ceremony of seven sisters
to bring strength to the moment."

1006
01:35:01,634 --> 01:35:04,929
Mrs. Bell is not the Healer.

1007
01:35:05,095 --> 01:35:07,306
It said the Healer could be a man.

1008
01:35:07,473 --> 01:35:10,017
But l... But l...
I saw a butterfly land right on her.

1009
01:35:10,184 --> 01:35:11,310
Butterflies?

1010
01:35:11,477 --> 01:35:14,939
Yeah, the bedtime story
said butterflies are drawn to the Healer.

1011
01:35:15,105 --> 01:35:17,566
But, Mr. Heep,
you brought that butterfly to me.

1012
01:35:17,733 --> 01:35:21,195
It caught my eye as you walked over.

1013
01:35:23,656 --> 01:35:25,074
I did?

1014
01:35:31,747 --> 01:35:33,582
Wait, no.

1015
01:35:33,749 --> 01:35:35,543
You must try.

1016
01:35:35,709 --> 01:35:38,921
- There's no time.
- I can't. I can't. I can't.

1017
01:35:39,088 --> 01:35:40,673
Shut up...

1018
01:35:41,674 --> 01:35:43,217
...and try.

1019
01:36:24,383 --> 01:36:27,636
Say something to bring out your energy.

1020
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,643
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

1021
01:36:40,608 --> 01:36:42,443
I should have been there.

1022
01:36:42,610 --> 01:36:44,945
I am always gonna regret...

1023
01:36:47,072 --> 01:36:49,575
...just not being there.

1024
01:36:55,247 --> 01:36:57,750
I'll miss your faces.

1025
01:37:00,586 --> 01:37:03,255
Oh, they remind me of God.

1026
01:37:09,428 --> 01:37:12,348
I'm so lost without you guys.

1027
01:37:17,937 --> 01:37:23,484
I met this very nice lady,
and her name's Story.

1028
01:37:24,819 --> 01:37:27,238
And I think you would've liked her.

1029
01:37:30,115 --> 01:37:32,326
I think she might be...

1030
01:37:34,078 --> 01:37:36,080
...an angel...

1031
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:40,960
...because she has to go home.

1032
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,008
I love you all.

1033
01:37:49,552 --> 01:37:52,221
I love you all so much.

Your sister will have seven children.

1036
01:38:56,118 --> 01:38:58,329
You will see the first two.

1037
01:41:13,839 --> 01:41:17,718
Oh, my God. He's the Guardian.

Reggie!

1039
01:41:19,678 --> 01:41:21,972
Reggie! Reggie,
just keep looking in his eyes!

1040
01:41:22,139 --> 01:41:24,558
Keep looking in his eyes!
