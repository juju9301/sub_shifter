1
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:42,323
Once, man and those in the water
were linked.

2
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:44,784
They inspired us.

3
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:47,203
They spoke of the future.

4
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:52,124
Man listened and it became real.

5
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,629
But man does not listen very well.

6
00:01:56,838 --> 00:02:02,635
Man 's need to own everything
led him deeper into land.

7
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:06,264
The magic world of the ones
that live in the ocean...

8
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:08,808
...and the world of men...

9
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:11,227
...separated.

10
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:15,731
Through the centuries, their world,
and all the inhabitants of it...

11
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:17,817
...stopped trying.

12
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:22,113
The world of man became more violent.

13
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:28,160
War upon war played out,
as there were no guides to listen to.

14
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:33,541
Now those in the water
are trying again...

15
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:36,294
...trying to reach us.

16
00:02:36,502 --> 00:02:41,424
A handful of their precious young ones
have been sent into the world of man.

17
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:44,302
They are brought in the dead of night...

18
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:47,847
...to where man lives.

19
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:50,850
They need only be glimpsed...

20
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:54,812
...and the awakening of man
will happen.

21
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:58,357
But their enemies roam the land.

22
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:02,028
There are laws that are meant
to keep the young ones safe...

23
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:06,115
...but they are sent
at great risk to their lives.

24
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:08,117
Many...

25
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:10,286
...do not return.

26
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:16,000
Yet still they try...

27
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:19,212
...try to help man.

28
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:26,135
But man may have
forgotten how to listen.

29
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:45,947
My daughter says to be careful,
Mr. Heep.

30
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:54,747
Well, it's some kind
of a b... B... B... Bug.

31
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:56,916
It's very big.

32
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,710
It's very hairy.

33
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:08,761
My other daughter says it's
some kind of creature the devil made.

34
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,263
Tell her it's not a creature.

35
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:13,641
There's no such thing as creatures,
all right?

36
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,434
You...

37
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:18,187
You might wanna turn away.

38
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:34,495
Sorry this is taking so long.

39
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:50,303
It's over. It's over.

40
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:53,347
It's... It's safe.

41
00:04:59,353 --> 00:05:04,483
My daughter says
thank you for protecting them.

42
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,282
Mr. Farber?

43
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:14,368
I'm Cleveland Heep.
Welcome to the Cove.

44
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:16,746
Mr. Heep!

45
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:24,086
You are new tenant?

46
00:05:27,253 --> 00:05:27,757
Yeah, this is Mr. Farber. He's in 13B.

47
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:31,385
Now, Mr. Farber, this is Young-Soon
Choi. She lives with her mother in 8A.

48
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:34,931
She's a student at the university.

49
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:37,850
Young-Soon, you don't know...

50
00:05:41,017 --> 00:05:41,771
...who's been swimming in the pool
the last few nights, do you?

51
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:44,232
No, Mr. Heep.

52
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:47,610
By the way, here. Thanks. I liked it.

53
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:49,403
You're welcome.

54
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,824
Mr. Heep loves learning.
He doesn't want people to know.

55
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:59,038
Mr. Heep, pool man looking for you.
I tell him you come soon.

56
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:03,584
Could you wait here just a moment,
please?

57
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:07,255
Gonna ask something. Answer straight.
You guys having parties in here?

58
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:09,799
Bubble parties, bubble bath,
everyone skinny-dipping?

59
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,217
No.

60
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:14,595
- Those bubbles make the water very slick.
- No.

61
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,226
I'll trust you on that. But something
is making this water like this.

62
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:24,063
There has been someone
swimming at nighttime.

63
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:29,068
I hear sp... Sp... Sp...
Splashing some nights.

64
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:33,281
I left here yesterday afternoon,
this filter was empty.

65
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:45,877
You kind of look like maybe
you could work out a little bit, right?

66
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:48,629
I could give you a vein like that.

67
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:52,466
I could make it look just like this. Right?

68
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:55,428
Most people say,
"What's wrong with you, Reggie?

69
00:06:58,636 --> 00:06:58,472
Why you only working out
on one side of your body?"

70
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,311
I tell them it's like an experiment.
I'm like a scientist.

71
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:11,694
This morning I measured my bicep.

72
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:16,115
Four-and-a-half-inch difference
from one side to the other.

73
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:17,867
Look at that.

74
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:20,328
Take a guess at the difference
between my thighs.

75
00:07:20,828 --> 00:07:22,205
- Hello, Reggie.
- Hey.

76
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:24,832
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hey.

77
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:27,793
Me and the new guy,
we're talking science.

78
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:30,588
Okay, that's great. Here we go, Mr. F...

79
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:33,090
Here we go. Come on.

80
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:38,679
Don't hang out in the stairwell,
Reggie, please.

81
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:41,140
- Okay.
- All right.

82
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:45,686
Just... People might trip.

83
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:46,896
All right.

84
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:50,024
Reggie's harmless.
He just wants to be special.

85
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:52,443
He's working out
only one side of his body.

86
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:55,363
Did he...? Did he tell you that?

87
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,406
- Be inside within minutes.

88
00:07:57,573 --> 00:07:58,824
Hello, Mr. Leeds.

89
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:02,703
Those soldiers are only now beginning to
wonder how long they'll end up staying.

90
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,833
If this does come to combat, we will not
be in the battle for the sake of the battle.

91
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:08,584
He's been here f... F... Forever.

92
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:11,170
- Will not be reached any other way.

93
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:17,301
Mrs. Bell, she takes in animals.
Smart lady. You'd like her.

94
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:23,516
- He... Not just because he died.
- There's a bunch of people better.

95
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:26,185
- Name four people better.
- Name one better than Fred.

96
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:30,773
Axl Rose. Sebastian Bach.
Bret Michaels is better than he is.

97
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:33,901
Bret Michaels.
I'd rather listen to Bon... Jon Bon Jovi.

98
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,236
What? Are you...?

99
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:37,071
This is you.

100
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:45,913
There's no smoking inside.

101
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:50,710
And there's no swimming after 7.

102
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:58,676
I hope it's okay to ask: What brings you
here from the West Coast, Mr. Farber?

103
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:02,013
I've been hired to be the local film
and book critic for the paper.

104
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,182
They flew you all the way
out here for that?

105
00:09:04,348 --> 00:09:08,686
- They did.
- Well, you must be very good.

106
00:09:27,496 --> 00:09:29,415
Mr. Heep, Betty Pen again.

107
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:33,586
I smell something awful
coming from the upstairs apartment.

108
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:39,008
I think someone may have died
and the body is decomposing.

109
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:42,553
I know I said this last week, but...

110
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:56,817
Not everyone here
spent Sunday practicing for war.

111
00:09:56,984 --> 00:10:01,030
At Sunday church services,
chaplains rallied the troops.

112
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:03,741
For these Marines,
a moment for prayer...

113
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:09,497
...at a service that many here believe
will be their last before going to war.

114
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:14,836
U.S. Forces predicted today the enemy,
estimated at 3 to 4000...

115
00:10:15,002 --> 00:10:16,671
...may be willing...

116
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:25,763
- a major... A major confrontation.

117
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,685
At the same time, the U.S. Military
will be fighting a propaganda war.

118
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:34,689
If there were a silver bullet,
we would've shot that a long time ago.

119
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:39,128
Hey! I saw you!

120
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:41,422
I saw you!

121
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:48,763
Come out of that pool right now!

122
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:51,474
Hey!

123
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:56,646
I'm gonna wait.

124
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:02,026
Hey.

125
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,115
Hey.

126
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:14,872
Come on out, now. It's...

127
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:18,584
It's... It's not safe.

128
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,881
Come on out. This is not f...

129
00:12:24,632 --> 00:12:26,717
This is not funny.

130
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:34,934
Please sto...

131
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:05,047
God.

132
00:14:13,905 --> 00:14:13,199
Did you pull me out?

133
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:22,458
Where are you from?

134
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,919
The Blue World.

135
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:27,421
Is that an apartment?

136
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:31,300
Do you feel an awakening?

137
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,928
I'm sorry?

138
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:37,557
It will feel like pins and needles...

139
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:40,142
...inside.

140
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:46,274
It is not you.

141
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:54,532
It's late.

142
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:57,076
You really...

143
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:01,956
You shouldn't be here.

144
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:06,836
I'm kind of old-fashioned that way.
I don't even know your name.

145
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:08,713
My name is Story.

146
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:11,048
I didn't mean for you to tell...

147
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:18,848
Why am I not stuttering?

148
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:20,474
What?

149
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:29,734
Hello, Story, my name is Cleveland.

150
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:31,861
"From the cliffs."

151
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,989
That is what your name means.

152
00:15:35,156 --> 00:15:36,991
Where did you learn that?

153
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:39,076
From my studies.

154
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:46,375
I promise that I will not
get you into trouble. You can go.

155
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,338
I am scared.

156
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:54,884
I will wait here with you, Cleveland.

157
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,929
Why are you scared?

158
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:14,070
You can wait here for a little bit...

159
00:16:14,237 --> 00:16:16,864
...until you feel not so scared.

160
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:22,870
Are you okay?

161
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,839
Oh, my God. You're just a kid.

162
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,443
Hello.

163
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:09,792
Okay. It's time to go. Story, come on.

164
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,468
Okay.

165
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:22,180
I think you need some fresh air.

166
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:24,515
I'm just gonna take you outside.

167
00:17:24,682 --> 00:17:26,976
I'm gonna put you
on one of the pool chairs.

168
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:29,520
I'm gonna get you some coffee...

169
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:31,939
...and then you can wake up.

170
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:35,526
Then I'll walk you home.

171
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:47,121
Tell me, who in the world
are you, anyway?

172
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:51,709
- Narf.
- What?

173
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:59,509
Okay. Come on.

174
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:01,552
Here we go.

175
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:15,525
Okay.

176
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:37,440
It was sort of h... H... Hairy, but...
But matted, like clumps. You know?

177
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:40,318
And it was kind of g... Green.

178
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:42,445
- You say green?
- Yeah.

179
00:19:42,612 --> 00:19:46,115
I thought so. Matted is... Is not right.

180
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:51,621
It was f... F... Flat, and...
And thicker than hair.

181
00:19:52,914 --> 00:19:57,126
Like this. Like this.
Flat and this kind of a color.

182
00:19:57,293 --> 00:20:02,590
- And... Is this not helping you at all?
- Forget about its hair for a second.

183
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:06,594
It's obviously some dumb animal
who muddied himself. About how tall?

184
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:09,347
- What, was it a Great Dane?
- No, no, no. No, sir.

185
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:13,518
I mean, are there any w... W...
Wolves in this area? Hyenas?

186
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:17,230
Jack, this is Philadelphia.
Where do you think you're living?

187
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:23,110
Sorry. Something keeps
setting off the sprinklers.

188
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:26,489
I'll look around the forest and check
behind the dumpsters and stuff.

189
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:28,908
An animal that size,
the one you're describing...

190
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:30,868
...doesn't walk around and not be seen.

191
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:33,788
There's nowhere for
a dumb big animal to hide.

192
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:45,341
Cleveland.

193
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:46,485
Hey.

194
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:49,030
Got a lot of homework, huh?

195
00:21:49,197 --> 00:21:51,699
University gives many pages of reading.

196
00:21:54,866 --> 00:21:54,702
What they think, I have no social life?

197
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:57,705
I got more books for you.

198
00:21:57,872 --> 00:22:01,834
Could you look up
the word "narf" for me?

199
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:06,672
It's an Eastern bedtime story, Mr. Heep.

200
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,049
I do not remember it.

201
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:11,177
My great-grandmother
used to tell it when she was alive.

202
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:13,888
A b... B... B...

203
00:22:17,972 --> 00:22:17,225
Bedtime story?

204
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:19,310
What's the story?

205
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:22,522
I do not remember.

206
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:26,734
How about your mother?

207
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,207
Hello, Mrs. Choi. Hello.

208
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:49,841
She wants to know
who told you this word.

209
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:54,595
Oh, j... Just a friend. I don't...
I don't... I don't know her very well.

210
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:01,143
She said that her grandmother...

211
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:07,441
...used to tell this story like a prayer.
Like it was true.

212
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:14,240
She said that she knew someone
who knew someone who saw one.

213
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:16,200
Saw one what?

214
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:24,584
A narf, the bedtime story says,
is a sea nymph.

215
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:31,674
I s... What...
What happens in the story, please?

216
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,642
No. Mrs...

217
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:51,402
In the bedtime story...

218
00:23:56,112 --> 00:23:56,991
...she must be seen
by the one human chosen for her.

219
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,167
This person is called the vessel.

220
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:11,422
Seeing the narf will awaken something
in the chosen one.

221
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:14,550
If she's successful in this...

222
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:21,766
...she will return with the Great Eatlon,
a giant eagle...

223
00:24:24,974 --> 00:24:24,352
...and become free.

224
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,980
She won't tell me more.

225
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:32,068
She said, why can't I be like
my older sister. She married a dentist.

226
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:48,251
Story?

227
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:52,046
Story?

228
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:56,717
Cleveland.

229
00:25:05,098 --> 00:25:05,685
Story, could you
put something back on, please?

230
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:22,076
Are you here to meet someone,
see someone in this building?

231
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:29,458
Is somebody supposed to see you?

232
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:35,256
Is...?

233
00:25:38,551 --> 00:25:39,635
L...

234
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:46,976
It is a writer.

235
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:55,526
Do you know his name?

236
00:26:00,698 --> 00:26:02,992
Do you know what he looks like?

237
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:10,500
Do you know if it's a...?
A woman or a man?

238
00:26:18,296 --> 00:26:18,132
Is there something
that you wanna tell me?

239
00:26:24,472 --> 00:26:29,185
Is this person
writing something important?

240
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:38,027
When do you have to leave?

241
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:42,114
I can leave tonight if I meet this person.

242
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:44,575
I'm gonna help you get home.

243
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:48,037
Thank you, Cleveland.

244
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:53,918
I have to go.

245
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:01,968
Hello. L... l...

246
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:04,679
I wanted to ask you
something about your work.

247
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:08,266
Your c... C... Critic work.

248
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:12,186
How's it... How's... How's...
How's it going?

249
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:17,275
I'm seeing a romance film tonight.
Not my cup of tea.

250
00:27:20,483 --> 00:27:20,027
So you... You...
You haven't written anything yet?

251
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:21,988
Haven't written anything
for some time.

252
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:25,074
You were right about that one tenant.

253
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:27,410
I spoke with Mrs. Bell.

254
00:27:27,577 --> 00:27:31,330
We got along.
She's very good with animals.

255
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:34,458
You know she wrote a book?

256
00:27:35,793 --> 00:27:39,630
Mr. Heep,
I will be taking the cat in directly.

257
00:27:40,214 --> 00:27:41,841
Don't worry, Mrs. Bell.

258
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:46,929
Lookie here.

259
00:27:48,764 --> 00:27:52,435
My, there's a lot of butterflies
around this building.

260
00:27:53,394 --> 00:27:58,107
Strange behavior for them.
They're not usually so trusting.

261
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:04,572
I understand that you're a writer,
Mrs. Bell.

262
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:06,324
Now, where'd you hear such things?

263
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:13,039
Maybe I read your book.

264
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:17,001
That'd be quite a trick.
It's been out of print for 20 years.

265
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:20,630
Twenty years?
So you haven't written anything recently?

266
00:28:20,838 --> 00:28:24,383
Mr. Farber has been speaking
out of turn.

267
00:28:27,803 --> 00:28:29,805
Look at this cereal character's picture,
Dad.

268
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:34,227
Looks like Aunt Sylvia when she found out
everybody hated her fruit-bowl painting.

269
00:28:35,686 --> 00:28:40,066
I need a nine-letter word
for "in human form."

270
00:28:43,816 --> 00:28:43,152
You'll figure it out, Dad.

271
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:45,154
I...

272
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:49,867
You know, the color on this box
look just like the colors of your car, Dad.

273
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:52,578
Maybe we should take your car
and go visit Aunt Sylvia.

274
00:28:52,745 --> 00:28:54,413
Incarnate.

275
00:28:56,874 --> 00:29:01,379
Well, you're very good
with those word puzzles, Mr. Dury.

276
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:05,091
He's a grand-master level.
I'm gonna be just like him.

277
00:29:08,258 --> 00:29:08,386
- So you like words a lot, huh?
- I adore them.

278
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:11,806
Are you... Are you writing anything,
Mr. Dury?

279
00:29:11,973 --> 00:29:13,474
A book, maybe?

280
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:14,851
No, l...

281
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:19,856
I'm afraid my skills are limited
to crossword puzzles.

282
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:23,693
That's some serious reekage, man.

283
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:26,404
You don't even speak English anymore.

284
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:30,241
What, reekage? Damn straight
it's English. The state of reek.

285
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:32,660
There's no "reekage," man.

286
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:38,291
Some toker just like us made it up
somewhere, and here you are speaking it.

287
00:29:38,624 --> 00:29:42,712
Let's make up a witty phrase.
It'll become famous.

288
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:46,007
It needs to be on some T-shirt
or something, you ass.

289
00:29:46,174 --> 00:29:51,512
No, it doesn't. It just catches on.
People just start saying it.

290
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,598
Blim-blam.

291
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:56,100
What? Blim-blam?

292
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:58,352
Somebody already said that.

293
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:04,233
Gentlemen, I don't suppose...

294
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,197
...any of you have written
anything lately.

295
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:14,577
An essay or something?

296
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:18,372
Something important?

297
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,374
No essays here, my man.

298
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,048
Okay. Stop putting your clothes
in the garbage disposal...

299
00:30:27,215 --> 00:30:29,717
...and stop smoking.

300
00:30:37,016 --> 00:30:39,268
Baby's on the half-tip.

301
00:30:41,687 --> 00:30:42,939
- Snap!
- Yeah.

302
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:45,525
There you go. There you go.

303
00:30:45,858 --> 00:30:46,901
Mr. Heep.

304
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:50,363
She told me a little bit more of the story
before she throw cushion at me.

305
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,739
Young-Soon.

306
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:55,368
You're not writing anything, are you?

307
00:30:55,535 --> 00:30:59,038
A p... P... P... Paper, maybe?

308
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:01,707
Writing? No, Mr. Heep.

309
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:07,171
This semester all multiple-choice
courses. Young-Soon is not stupid.

310
00:31:11,673 --> 00:31:11,926
She told me about a bad guy in story.

311
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:15,429
These creatures are called scrunts.

312
00:31:15,596 --> 00:31:19,308
They are meant to kill a narf
when she is out of the water.

313
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:22,144
They can lay completely flat.

314
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:25,022
Their back is covered in grass.

315
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:28,860
My great-grandmother said
that's why man never sees them.

316
00:31:32,026 --> 00:31:32,321
They will appear
as a bump in the lawns.

317
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:24,749
Vick. Anna.

318
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:28,419
Mr. Heep, the light over my desk
is still not working.

319
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:31,839
I promise I'll get to it.
How's the writing?

320
00:32:35,006 --> 00:32:35,635
- Slow.
- You look tired, Mr. Heep.

321
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:40,765
How long have you been writing, Vick?

322
00:32:41,224 --> 00:32:43,100
Six months.

323
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:46,562
What? I should finish, right?

324
00:32:49,729 --> 00:32:49,941
It just... It just sits on his desk.
My brother's scared.

325
00:32:50,107 --> 00:32:51,984
He'll do anything to get out of writing.

326
00:32:55,151 --> 00:32:55,488
See this? It's the third load of laundry
he's done this week.

327
00:32:57,114 --> 00:32:59,742
I can fix that light now, if you want.

328
00:33:43,244 --> 00:33:44,996
A cookbook.

329
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:50,209
This has gotten s... S...

330
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:55,214
Silly.

331
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:02,430
- That's not how you fold.
- Mr. Heep, tell her to stop annoying me.

332
00:34:02,597 --> 00:34:03,848
I fixed the light.

333
00:34:04,015 --> 00:34:05,975
I'll make you dinner, Mr. Heep.
Thank you.

334
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:07,560
You're both cooks?

335
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:11,939
Who, him? He can't cook.
He's banned from the kitchen.

336
00:34:17,987 --> 00:34:19,989
Wait a minute,
I don't understand something.

337
00:34:20,156 --> 00:34:22,700
I'm sorry. My... My ladder...

338
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:26,537
...accidentally bumped into your desk.

339
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:30,249
I ended up seeing the title
of what it is you're writing.

340
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,084
It said The Cookbook.

341
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:34,504
I know, it's a bad title, right?

342
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:39,800
It's actually, you know, just my thoughts
on all our cultural problems...

343
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:42,178
...and thoughts on leaders and stuff.

344
00:34:45,345 --> 00:34:45,348
I don't know who's gonna
wanna publish the thing.

345
00:34:47,016 --> 00:34:49,393
That is not how you fold.

346
00:35:03,988 --> 00:35:03,491
Your thoughts are very sad.

347
00:35:09,994 --> 00:35:09,580
Most are of one night.

348
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:15,211
A night a man entered your home
when you were not there.

349
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:21,050
He stole many things
and killed your wife and children.

350
00:35:25,218 --> 00:35:25,179
That is when you stopped being happy.

351
00:35:28,182 --> 00:35:30,226
You were a doctor.

352
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:35,398
I am very sorry for you.

353
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:39,819
You believe you have no purpose.

354
00:35:40,236 --> 00:35:42,572
You help all that live here.

355
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:45,616
Anybody can do this job, Story.

356
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:48,077
You have a purpose.

357
00:35:51,953 --> 00:35:51,664
All beings have a purpose.

358
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,922
I know who you are.

359
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:04,927
And I think that I've found your vessel.

360
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:08,014
You know what I'm talking about, right?

361
00:36:13,725 --> 00:36:13,102
He's outside.
Do you need to see him alone...

362
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:15,563
...or does he just need to see you?

363
00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:28,075
Cover yourself up.

364
00:36:32,622 --> 00:36:33,873
Hey.

365
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,626
Mr. Heep, I know I sent in that form.

366
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:39,170
- I gave it to you on the stairs.
- Okay.

367
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:43,633
- My sister's all angry at me now.
- Well, I'll check again.

368
00:36:45,134 --> 00:36:47,803
By the way, this is my friend, Story.

369
00:36:50,973 --> 00:36:52,475
Hi.

370
00:37:08,157 --> 00:37:10,701
Yeah, you were right. Here it is.

371
00:37:12,036 --> 00:37:13,496
Great.

372
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:19,794
You all right? You look a little...

373
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:25,758
I'm feeling a little funny. It's nothing.

374
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:30,263
Is it a pins-and-needles kind of feeling?

375
00:37:31,722 --> 00:37:33,516
Yeah, kind of.

376
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,144
Yeah.

377
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:41,190
Maybe you should go lie down.

378
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:48,865
Nice meeting you.

379
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:52,952
I'm so very happy we saw each other.

380
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:18,477
You don't have to leave right now,
do you?

381
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:22,899
I have to go finish a couple of things.
I'll be back.

382
00:38:23,065 --> 00:38:24,692
Is that okay?

383
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:27,487
Your words are very beautiful.

384
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:32,074
Your heart is very big.

385
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:45,838
No one knows about my family here.

386
00:38:47,882 --> 00:38:52,845
Please do not bring it up again.

387
00:39:04,732 --> 00:39:06,317
Coming.

388
00:39:07,652 --> 00:39:12,406
Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Bubchik.
It's... It's been a long day.

389
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:13,950
Come on.

390
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:20,081
Listen, he's on the toilet.
He's been having some gas issues.

391
00:39:20,248 --> 00:39:21,457
Don't tell him I told you.

392
00:39:24,624 --> 00:39:24,544
L... I thought the toilet was broken.
That's why I came.

393
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:29,382
He may just be looking in the mirror.
I mean, he's got this growth on his ass.

394
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:32,301
Don't tell him I told you.

395
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:37,473
Honey, Cleveland's here.
He's come to fix the toilet.

396
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:40,685
Tell him I had it fixed already.
I called the plumber this morning.

397
00:39:43,852 --> 00:39:43,980
- Don't let it hurt his feelings.
- Right.

398
00:39:47,647 --> 00:39:47,400
It's... It's... It's okay.

399
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:51,154
I should come when you call.
It's my job.

400
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:55,908
What if that thing's out there?
It'll try to get you?

401
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:58,911
There are laws. It will be safe.

402
00:39:59,078 --> 00:40:01,664
I'm allowed to leave this night.

403
00:40:13,798 --> 00:40:13,384
- How long do you think?
- It is time.

404
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:14,844
You must not watch.

405
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:17,471
Am I not allowed to watch you leave?

406
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:19,724
I won't watch.

407
00:40:19,891 --> 00:40:23,019
Thank you for letting me wear
your beautiful shirt.

408
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:24,854
You keep it.

409
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,239
What happened?

410
00:42:02,615 --> 00:42:02,201
Okay. Okay.

411
00:42:02,368 --> 00:42:06,956
Hey. Calm down. Calm down.

412
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:09,250
How'd you get those scratches?

413
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:12,503
Did the eagle come?

414
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:17,258
Did something go wrong? Story.

415
00:42:20,425 --> 00:42:20,845
Story. Was it that dog again?

416
00:42:28,144 --> 00:42:30,897
What's happening?
I thought it was gonna be safe.

417
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:47,830
Your face doesn't look right.
Are you okay?

418
00:42:50,124 --> 00:42:52,460
Mr. Heep is here. He has a friend.

419
00:42:52,627 --> 00:42:54,420
She's beautiful.

420
00:42:54,587 --> 00:42:56,839
She's not feeling that well:

421
00:42:57,006 --> 00:42:58,841
So she's lying down in my room.

422
00:42:59,008 --> 00:43:01,427
Why is she here?
Why isn't she at his place?

423
00:43:04,594 --> 00:43:04,764
Well, she got sick
in the stairwell downstairs.

424
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:10,186
She's wearing no clothes
under his shirt.

425
00:43:10,353 --> 00:43:11,771
Blim-blam.

426
00:43:16,564 --> 00:43:16,901
Mr. Heep is a player.

427
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:26,869
- I hope it's all right.
- It's fine.

428
00:43:27,036 --> 00:43:28,746
Do we need to take her to a hospital?

429
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:31,707
- Oh, no. No, no, no. That's f... F... F...
- Fine?

430
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,502
Thank you.

431
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:37,171
No, she just needs some rest.

432
00:43:37,338 --> 00:43:39,674
She can stay here
as long as she needs to.

433
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,344
You started writing again?

434
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:46,889
Yeah.

435
00:43:50,473 --> 00:43:50,059
I'll be right back. Okay?

436
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:02,864
Hello. M... Mrs. Choi,
is Young-Soon at home?

437
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,407
No home.

438
00:44:07,574 --> 00:44:07,326
Great. Unbelievable.

439
00:44:16,499 --> 00:44:16,002
Hey. Hey.

440
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:19,714
Thanks.

441
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:23,259
- Yeah, hello?
- Mr. Heep?

442
00:44:23,426 --> 00:44:25,928
- Where are you?
- At a club.

443
00:44:26,095 --> 00:44:28,639
Don 't tell my mother.
She thinks I'm at a dance class.

444
00:44:28,806 --> 00:44:30,099
Okay.

445
00:44:33,474 --> 00:44:33,769
What happens if a narf gets scratched?

446
00:44:33,936 --> 00:44:37,940
I don 't know.
Put my mother on, I'll ask her.

447
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,777
Mrs... Mrs. Choi. Mrs...

448
00:44:56,459 --> 00:44:58,878
- Hey.
- Hey. Thank you.

449
00:45:00,046 --> 00:45:02,715
Oh, she... She... She...
She doesn't look happy.

450
00:45:05,924 --> 00:45:05,510
She said the story
her grandmother told...

451
00:45:08,718 --> 00:45:08,888
...said a scrunt has poison
that kill narfs.

452
00:45:09,055 --> 00:45:13,309
But she said
narfs can protect themselves.

453
00:45:13,476 --> 00:45:17,230
They are given a mud called Kii
that cures them.

454
00:45:17,396 --> 00:45:19,732
They keep it where they live.

455
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:22,652
Okay, okay.

456
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:28,991
All right. Now, you said that the eagle
comes to take them back.

457
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,994
Right.
Now, what stops this green thing...

458
00:45:32,203 --> 00:45:36,332
...from attacking them
when the eagle comes?

459
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:38,084
You're funny, Mr. Heep.

460
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:40,545
- Yeah, I know.
- You really thought about this.

461
00:45:40,753 --> 00:45:42,922
Put my mom on.

462
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:07,363
- Hey.
- Yeah. Hey. I'm sorry.

463
00:46:07,947 --> 00:46:09,157
Yes?

464
00:46:12,365 --> 00:46:12,368
She said only a rogue scrunt
will break the law of that night...

465
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:14,370
...because most scrunts are afraid.

466
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:16,289
Afraid of what?

467
00:46:16,497 --> 00:46:21,294
Tartutic. They are the law keepers
in this bedtime story.

468
00:46:24,502 --> 00:46:24,338
Her grandmother said
there are three of them...

469
00:46:27,505 --> 00:46:27,633
...but they are called one name:
Tartutic.

470
00:46:27,842 --> 00:46:32,054
They live in the trees.
They are said to look like monkeys.

471
00:46:32,513 --> 00:46:37,643
No one knows for sure because
no one who has seen them has lived.

472
00:46:37,852 --> 00:46:41,898
The legend says
that they were born so evil...

473
00:46:45,064 --> 00:46:45,568
...that they killed their parents
on the night they were born.

474
00:46:45,776 --> 00:46:50,990
The fear of them has kept justice
in The Blue World for centuries.

475
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:53,159
Bye, Mr. Heep.

476
00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:01,209
Thanks.

477
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:22,563
They are given a mud called Kii
that cures them.

478
00:47:25,772 --> 00:47:25,066
They keep it where they live.

479
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:27,665
My mom figured out I was at a club.
She made me come home.

480
00:50:27,832 --> 00:50:29,625
She tell me more of the story.

481
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:32,503
- Why you wet?
- That's... Apartment business.

482
00:50:34,714 --> 00:50:39,093
Listen, Mr. Heep,
my mother thinks of you as stranger.

483
00:50:42,385 --> 00:50:42,889
You have to make her
see you as a child, innocent.

484
00:50:46,055 --> 00:50:46,017
Then she will tell you the bedtime story.

485
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,769
There is a reason
the rules might be broken.

486
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:52,648
A Thousand Narfs is about a rare narf...

487
00:50:55,815 --> 00:50:55,193
...who comes once
in a generation of narfs...

488
00:50:58,359 --> 00:50:58,362
...who is called the Madam Narf.

489
00:50:58,529 --> 00:51:02,033
Her vessel is important.
This vessel will cause change.

490
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,038
But it is the Madam Narf herself
that is truly the key.

491
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:10,708
She's considered
a queen to her people.

492
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:14,629
Her return will be seen
as a great inspiration.

493
00:51:14,795 --> 00:51:18,341
A scrunt will do anything
to kill a Madam Narf...

494
00:51:21,508 --> 00:51:21,219
...even forget his fears of the Tartutic.

495
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:24,764
He might break the rules for that,
Mr. Heep.

496
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:28,351
Will she know
that she's a Madam Narf?

497
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:32,146
No, that is moral of bedtime story.

498
00:51:35,313 --> 00:51:35,358
No one is ever told who they are.

499
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,485
I think we are linked.

500
00:51:40,652 --> 00:51:40,196
It's more than just a story to me too.

501
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,865
I actually want to believe it.

502
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:45,743
Goodbye, Mr. Heep.

503
00:52:02,093 --> 00:52:04,679
You have saved my life again.

504
00:52:06,472 --> 00:52:08,641
You made that room.

505
00:52:11,102 --> 00:52:15,106
The cracks that I saw. Is that room
supposed to collapse eventually?

506
00:52:18,273 --> 00:52:18,734
I'm not allowed to speak
of The Blue World.

507
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:21,612
Well, the door needs a little work.

508
00:52:27,073 --> 00:52:27,743
I noticed that you took things
from the apartment...

509
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:30,454
...that people left around the pool.

510
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:36,627
That's how I saw you.
You were taking something off of a chair.

511
00:52:43,384 --> 00:52:47,013
I think I might know why
the scrunt needs to get you so bad.

512
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,891
Why did he break the rules tonight?

513
00:52:50,057 --> 00:52:54,061
As it turns out,
I think that you're someone...

514
00:52:54,479 --> 00:52:58,107
...very important to everyone.

515
00:53:40,146 --> 00:53:40,858
I tried to tell them about you.
I don't know if I did the right thing.

516
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,861
I'm not sure how they're gonna react.

517
00:53:44,028 --> 00:53:45,988
I trust you.

518
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:49,033
I believe you are here to protect me.

519
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:55,206
Is the Kii working?

520
00:53:55,373 --> 00:53:57,416
Yes, thank you.

521
00:54:01,376 --> 00:54:01,337
If it is true that I am...

522
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,840
He will keep coming after me.

523
00:54:04,006 --> 00:54:06,801
I will not be safe until...

524
00:54:09,968 --> 00:54:09,303
Until Tartutic comes.

525
00:54:26,526 --> 00:54:26,487
My mother said she saw a ghost once,
in the basement.

526
00:54:29,654 --> 00:54:29,282
I was the only one who believed her.

527
00:54:29,448 --> 00:54:31,909
She's not an apparition, Anna.

528
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,997
I don't know who you are...

529
00:54:37,206 --> 00:54:39,667
...but you did something to me.

530
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,838
My thoughts.

531
00:54:50,925 --> 00:54:50,428
Everything became clearer.

532
00:54:51,596 --> 00:54:55,766
The fears that were muddling
my thoughts just went away.

533
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,686
I can hear myself.

534
00:55:01,105 --> 00:55:03,733
Do you wish to know your future?

535
00:55:12,614 --> 00:55:12,825
A boy in the Midwest of this land...

536
00:55:12,992 --> 00:55:17,413
...will grow up in a home where your book
will be on the shelf and spoken of often.

537
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:20,791
He will grow up
with these ideas in his head.

538
00:55:24,209 --> 00:55:24,295
He will grow into a great orator.

539
00:55:27,879 --> 00:55:27,840
He will speak and his words
will be heard throughout this land...

540
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:30,301
...and throughout the world.

541
00:55:31,093 --> 00:55:35,389
This boy will become
leader of this country...

542
00:55:38,556 --> 00:55:38,434
...and begin a movement
of great change.

543
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:42,230
He will speak of you and your words.

544
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:46,818
Your book will be the seeds
of many of his great thoughts.

545
00:55:51,986 --> 00:55:51,656
It will be the seeds of change.

546
00:55:54,242 --> 00:55:56,285
The Cookbook?

547
00:56:07,335 --> 00:56:07,171
One, two, three.

548
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,040
Oh, jeez.

549
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:56,888
Could you tell her that I was interested
in hearing more of the story?

550
00:57:32,504 --> 00:57:32,548
Tell her it's a beautiful story.

551
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:37,220
Are there... Are there any parts
that might be good to hear?

552
00:58:00,868 --> 00:58:02,912
- How is she?
- The medicine's helping her.

553
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,998
I told her to stay under the shower.
She does better with water.

554
00:58:09,165 --> 00:58:09,210
I need to talk with her.
And Vick should be there too.

555
00:58:10,711 --> 00:58:15,049
I told them to wait right outside.
I'll tell them what you have to say.

556
00:58:15,842 --> 00:58:19,428
Tell her I know that she is not allowed
to tell about her world...

557
00:58:19,595 --> 00:58:23,891
...but maybe I could ask some questions,
and she can just say if it's right or wrong.

558
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,604
Know what I did when I was little and me
and my girlfriends would get in trouble?

559
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:30,940
My mom always wanted to know
what happened...

560
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,317
...but I was like,
"I can't tell on my friends."

561
00:58:33,484 --> 00:58:37,905
So she came up with this way
of me telling her things without talking.

562
00:58:38,072 --> 00:58:42,118
She would say, "Touch your ear
or something if the answer is yes."

563
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:44,829
So I would, and then
she would know certain things...

564
00:58:47,996 --> 00:58:47,999
...but I didn't really feel
like I told on my friends.

565
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:52,712
It was cheating, I know,
but made me feel better.

566
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,422
We're ready.

567
00:59:00,508 --> 00:59:00,636
So in this bedtime story...

568
00:59:03,803 --> 00:59:03,973
...the narf has come
to a preordained place.

569
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:07,685
She must leave from the same spot.

570
00:59:10,852 --> 00:59:10,605
This eagle, the Great Eatlon,
coming to take her back...

571
00:59:10,771 --> 00:59:12,315
...is really very important.

572
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,484
And here's the good stuff.

573
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:18,571
There are humans
with powers that can help her.

574
00:59:21,738 --> 00:59:21,282
And these people
have been unconsciously drawn...

575
00:59:21,449 --> 00:59:23,618
...to live near the vessel.

576
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:26,329
Now, these humans
don't know who they are...

577
00:59:29,496 --> 00:59:29,707
...and they always
appear in the story earlier.

578
00:59:32,874 --> 00:59:32,668
Are there humans with powers
that can help you...

579
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,420
...but don't know who they are?

580
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:37,006
That's a yes!

581
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:43,804
They've got weird names:
A Symbolist, a Guardian and a Guild.

582
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:45,139
Ask her if that's right.

583
00:59:48,392 --> 00:59:50,520
You want something.

584
00:59:54,354 --> 00:59:54,065
One of them. Vick.

585
00:59:54,232 --> 00:59:58,945
Mr. Heep. Mr. Heep is one of them.

586
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,990
Which one? Guild, Guardian?

587
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:07,411
She thinks Mr. Heep is the Guardian.

588
01:00:08,996 --> 01:00:12,166
I was told that there's a Symbolist...

589
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:15,711
...an interpreter who can read signs
in clouds and other forms.

590
01:00:18,878 --> 01:00:18,214
He will interpret messages...

591
01:00:22,215 --> 01:00:22,009
...from the universe
if problems should arise.

592
01:00:25,176 --> 01:00:25,304
Do you know who the Symbolist
or Interpreter is?

593
01:00:25,763 --> 01:00:27,723
That's a no.

594
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:31,894
And I was told that there is a Guild...

595
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,856
...whose many hands
will combine to help.

596
01:00:35,022 --> 01:00:36,941
Does she know who they are?

597
01:00:37,108 --> 01:00:39,318
There is a Guild or something.

598
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:42,280
They're supposed to help
with their hands.

599
01:00:42,989 --> 01:00:44,907
That's another no.

600
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:47,910
All right, there's one other.

601
01:00:51,077 --> 01:00:51,706
I don't know if it's worth mentioning.
It's not in the stories all the time.

602
01:00:51,873 --> 01:00:55,376
It's a human, usually a female...

603
01:00:55,543 --> 01:00:57,253
...so full of hope...

604
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:02,258
...that they can awaken
the life force in all things.

605
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,594
Now, that one is called the Healer.

606
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,929
And you can tell
that they're in the story...

607
01:01:10,096 --> 01:01:10,057
...because butterflies
are drawn to the Healer.

608
01:01:14,976 --> 01:01:14,687
- Butterflies.
- The last one's a Healer.

609
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:17,440
You don't know
any of these people, do you?

610
01:01:26,112 --> 01:01:26,282
Reading? A book?

611
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,367
Learning.

612
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:32,371
She thinks it has to be learned.

613
01:01:32,538 --> 01:01:34,832
Is the eagle
going to come back for her?

614
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:39,670
Only one last time.

615
01:01:40,213 --> 01:01:42,340
Mr. Heep,
you know the people in this building.

616
01:01:42,507 --> 01:01:44,133
You have to find them.

617
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,142
What is it?

618
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,520
You know these walls are paper-thin?

619
01:01:55,686 --> 01:01:59,065
I can hear all that bloody noise
downstairs like they were in my kitchen.

620
01:01:59,232 --> 01:02:01,526
Can you do anything about that?

621
01:02:03,444 --> 01:02:05,196
Of course not.

622
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:09,951
- What is it you want, anyway?
- Well, I had a question.

623
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:14,121
You're an expert on p... P... Plots, right?

624
01:02:14,288 --> 01:02:19,085
You know who's gonna do what in a book
or a movie even at the beginning, yes?

625
01:02:22,252 --> 01:02:22,630
There is no originality left in the world,
Mr. Heep.

626
01:02:22,797 --> 01:02:24,841
That is a sad fact I've come to live with.

627
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:29,554
Well, if there was a mystery...

628
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:33,099
...and a guy had to figure out
who some people were...

629
01:02:36,266 --> 01:02:36,519
...like he had to find a symbol guy...

630
01:02:39,686 --> 01:02:39,856
...someone who can
figure out messages...

631
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:45,945
...and a guild of people who are going
to be important at the end as a group.

632
01:02:46,445 --> 01:02:48,823
How would you figure that out?

633
01:02:50,074 --> 01:02:52,910
The symbol person should be simple.

634
01:02:56,327 --> 01:02:56,831
Look for any character
who is doing something mundane...

635
01:02:56,998 --> 01:02:58,708
...but required analysis.

636
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:02,253
Someone who was skilled at puzzles.

637
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:04,714
Joey, you can't have cereal for lunch.

638
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:08,968
This picture on the cereal box
is supposed to make you feel happy.

639
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:13,389
I feel sad, like that time
you forgot to pick me up at school.

640
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:19,145
Joey, Mr. Heep appears disquieted.
Can you give us a moment alone?

641
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,814
Sure, Dad.

642
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,276
As for the guild...

643
01:03:28,443 --> 01:03:28,571
...Iook for any group of characters
that are always seen together...

644
01:03:31,738 --> 01:03:31,616
...and have seemingly irrelevant
and tedious dialogue...

645
01:03:34,782 --> 01:03:34,076
...that seems to regurgitate forever.

646
01:03:37,243 --> 01:03:37,622
And you just sit around
and talk about nothing?

647
01:03:40,788 --> 01:03:40,666
Oh, we talk about serious issues.

648
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,585
On occasion.

649
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:49,926
We talked about Martin Luther King
at the Tequila Hut Tuesday night.

650
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,304
You talked about that?

651
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:56,432
This is the writer's way
of establishing characters...

652
01:03:59,599 --> 01:03:59,477
...who will be important
further in the story.

653
01:04:02,852 --> 01:04:02,980
Is there anything further
I can assist you with during my naptime?

654
01:04:06,147 --> 01:04:06,984
No. No, Mr. Farber. Thank you.

655
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:25,461
Story, these young men are the Guild.

656
01:04:28,628 --> 01:04:28,673
And Mr. Dury... Mr. Dury?

657
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:32,718
Mr. Dury is the Interpreter.

658
01:04:37,053 --> 01:04:37,932
And there's one other person.
Mrs. Bell, could you come in here, please?

659
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:42,395
This is Mrs. Bell, the Healer.

660
01:04:46,771 --> 01:04:46,941
Story wants to go home and she can't.

661
01:04:47,108 --> 01:04:49,652
Tomorrow night is her last chance.

662
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,697
Mr. Dury, please step forward.

663
01:04:52,864 --> 01:04:57,285
- Mr. Heep, you're not stuttering.
- Yes, I know. I know. It's only around her.

664
01:05:00,204 --> 01:05:04,292
Now, the Interpreter will tell us what
to do if something should go wrong.

665
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:08,421
He will use an instrument
specific to him...

666
01:05:08,588 --> 01:05:10,464
...to interpret.

667
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,843
- Try it, Mr. Dury.
- I don't...

668
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,512
Let's just see what happens.

669
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:20,099
I think that there's
a message in there for us.

670
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:29,650
Well, nine letters across
is the word "essential."

671
01:05:34,777 --> 01:05:34,530
And it touches...

672
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:39,619
...27 down, which is "scheme."

673
01:05:42,785 --> 01:05:42,079
- Essential scheme.
- Yes.

674
01:05:45,246 --> 01:05:45,541
Now, those were the first two words
that I deciphered in this puzzle...

675
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:49,086
...and I thought that was...
Well, I thought that was weird.

676
01:05:53,799 --> 01:05:55,968
There's a word that seems
out of place to me.

677
01:05:59,135 --> 01:05:59,722
- Yes.
- It's a six-letter word for "get-together."

678
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:01,766
- "Soiree."
- Soiree.

679
01:06:05,517 --> 01:06:05,561
Soiree could mean "party." How
could a...? How does a party help us?

680
01:06:08,728 --> 01:06:08,523
Well, I guess I thought that, you know...

681
01:06:08,689 --> 01:06:13,861
...a party is interesting because
this thing out there is an animal...

682
01:06:14,028 --> 01:06:16,614
...and it probably has
a very keen sense of smell.

683
01:06:16,781 --> 01:06:20,618
- Why is everyone staring at me?
- Go on. Go on, Mr. Dury. Go on.

684
01:06:20,785 --> 01:06:24,539
Humans have a pungent smell
to animals...

685
01:06:24,705 --> 01:06:28,084
...so I thought that maybe everyone
gathered together would confuse him...

686
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:32,004
...and he wouldn't be able to distinguish
her from amongst all of us.

687
01:06:32,171 --> 01:06:33,256
Does that sound right?

688
01:06:36,422 --> 01:06:36,050
He's hearing the voice of God
through a crossword puzzle.

689
01:06:39,217 --> 01:06:39,262
- We're just playing here, right?
- No. Wait, wait.

690
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:44,016
See, I don't think that the Great Eatlon...

691
01:06:47,183 --> 01:06:47,979
...will land in the presence
of beings not from its world.

692
01:06:51,312 --> 01:06:51,232
She didn't want me to watch
when the eagle came the first time.

693
01:06:51,399 --> 01:06:53,526
That's before she knew
that I was the Guardian.

694
01:06:53,693 --> 01:06:55,444
Would I be able to watch now?

695
01:07:00,238 --> 01:07:00,616
But there will be...
There'll be hundreds of people at a party.

696
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:04,453
It won't work. It won't work. See if
there's anything else in there, Mr. Dury.

697
01:07:05,997 --> 01:07:09,125
This word did give me great difficulty,
and then it came to me.

698
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:12,795
- "Sonorous."
- Sonorous, sonorous.

699
01:07:15,962 --> 01:07:15,923
It could mean music, a band.

700
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:20,511
Maybe we gather everyone inside
at the last minute to hear a band...

701
01:07:20,678 --> 01:07:24,140
...and we who are of the world
stay with her...

702
01:07:24,307 --> 01:07:28,102
...to help her with that thing and...

703
01:07:28,269 --> 01:07:30,021
Until she's taken.

704
01:07:31,105 --> 01:07:32,815
He's a prophet.

705
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:36,152
We're all just seeing what we want to.
I just made all that up.

706
01:07:39,319 --> 01:07:39,030
No, I think that it worked.
I think that it worked.

707
01:07:39,197 --> 01:07:41,908
That is why they're the Guild.

708
01:07:42,074 --> 01:07:46,120
I think they're supposed
to use their hands to throw us a party.

709
01:07:46,287 --> 01:07:48,748
- Is he serious?
- We're gonna throw a party.

710
01:07:49,457 --> 01:07:53,002
- Huge party. We are serious.
- Tell them...

711
01:07:56,169 --> 01:07:56,297
Anything you can do for us,
all right? Tables...

712
01:07:56,464 --> 01:08:00,009
We definitely need a band. It's like
the most important thing. Oh, my God.

713
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:09,727
You don't think this is gonna work,
do you?

714
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:13,523
I'm nervous too.

715
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:17,109
You being out there tomorrow night.

716
01:08:20,568 --> 01:08:20,780
Me not knowing what to do
as the Guardian.

717
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:27,203
Think I can go out there tonight
and maybe face that thing without you?

718
01:08:28,412 --> 01:08:30,748
Get a little practice with him?

719
01:08:30,915 --> 01:08:32,875
Scare him, maybe?

720
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,044
Show him who's boss?

721
01:08:41,673 --> 01:08:41,092
I know you wanna get home.

722
01:08:50,351 --> 01:08:52,478
You will need a mirror.

723
01:08:53,312 --> 01:08:55,773
Can you hear me? I'm here.

724
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:58,526
Peer over your shoulder carefully.

725
01:08:58,693 --> 01:09:03,406
It is only through a mirror that one can
see the eyes of a scrunt in the grass.

726
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:08,452
It will appear to you
as two red spots in the darkness.

727
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:12,540
Yeah, l... I don 't... I...

728
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:15,668
Wait.

729
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:18,045
I see him.

730
01:09:21,174 --> 01:09:23,843
The Guardian has instincts
of when the scrunt will attack.

731
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:26,846
He is a great weapon against him.

732
01:09:27,513 --> 01:09:31,684
You should walk backwards
towards him.

733
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:34,937
When you are close enough
to be certain of his position...

734
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:37,690
...turn and face the hidden scrunt.

735
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:44,238
I'm facing him.

736
01:09:45,364 --> 01:09:47,325
I am scared.

737
01:09:50,783 --> 01:09:50,578
It is about to get very dangerous.

738
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,663
Okay.

739
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:56,250
I'm ready.

740
01:09:57,210 --> 01:10:02,298
You must invoke the ancient words
"Nef Ra Mora."

741
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:07,762
It is a command to rise
and a challenge to fight.

742
01:10:16,854 --> 01:10:18,731
What is happening?

743
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:22,819
He's rising out of the grass.

744
01:10:27,278 --> 01:10:27,615
His legs are bending and coiling...

745
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:30,243
...underneath him.

746
01:10:30,535 --> 01:10:34,705
Oh, my God. Oh, my... Oh, no.

747
01:10:35,414 --> 01:10:36,874
He's standing in front of me.

748
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,751
The Guardian can hypnotize a scrunt.

749
01:10:41,918 --> 01:10:41,504
If the Guardian looks directly
into the scrunt's eyes...

750
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:45,299
...it will be compelled to stay frozen
or move backwards.

751
01:10:48,842 --> 01:10:48,678
What is the J.G. Scrunt's reaction?
Is he frightened?

752
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:50,346
I'm not sure.

753
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:52,640
- Look into his eyes.
- I am.

754
01:10:55,807 --> 01:10:55,393
- Is he moving away?
- No.

755
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,687
The Guardian can control his mind.

756
01:11:00,854 --> 01:11:00,731
The J.G. Scrunt will not
be able to attack.

757
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:05,695
- Okay.
- You must look into his eyes.

758
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:07,613
I think something's wrong.

759
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:09,866
He's stepping forward.

760
01:11:10,491 --> 01:11:12,076
He's stepping forward?

761
01:11:12,243 --> 01:11:14,245
Something's wrong!

762
01:11:19,664 --> 01:11:19,208
Cleveland, run!

763
01:11:28,131 --> 01:11:28,467
What is it you are doing?

764
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:31,804
Hey there.

765
01:11:33,639 --> 01:11:38,686
Anything I can do for you there,
Mr. F... F... F... Farber?

766
01:11:39,145 --> 01:11:40,646
No.

767
01:11:47,612 --> 01:11:51,407
So how was the m... Movie?

768
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:53,242
- Sucked.
- Oh, what a... What a shame.

769
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:57,079
Characters were walking around
saying their thoughts out loud.

770
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:58,831
Who does that?

771
01:11:58,998 --> 01:12:00,249
And a typical romance...

772
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:04,629
...where the couple finally tell each other
they love one another in the rain.

773
01:12:05,338 --> 01:12:09,425
Why does everyone like to stand around
and talk in the rain in movies?

774
01:12:10,009 --> 01:12:12,178
Well, maybe...

775
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:16,808
Maybe it's a metaphor for purification,
starting new.

776
01:12:20,934 --> 01:12:20,770
No. It's not.

777
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,189
Are you okay?

778
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:28,069
He'll choose to move
only when no one is looking.

779
01:12:28,236 --> 01:12:30,363
They're masters of hiding.

780
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:34,450
A scrunt will hide unless
he cannot hide in his environment.

781
01:12:37,617 --> 01:12:37,662
If a tenant hadn't walked by...

782
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:40,456
...I'd have been eaten alive.

783
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,836
I had no powers over him.

784
01:12:45,002 --> 01:12:47,421
You are not the Guardian.

785
01:12:51,923 --> 01:12:51,384
I do not understand.

786
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:00,184
I cannot protect you.

787
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:03,437
Where are the Tartutic?

788
01:13:03,604 --> 01:13:05,982
Why isn't he being punished?

789
01:13:09,774 --> 01:13:09,277
Where is the justice?

790
01:13:28,087 --> 01:13:30,548
How come you don't ask
about bedtime story anymore?

791
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:36,512
I've been busy.

792
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:45,229
You... You coming to the party tonight?

793
01:13:45,605 --> 01:13:47,440
I have to study.

794
01:13:47,607 --> 01:13:49,442
Bye, Mr. Heep.

795
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:59,285
Mr. Leeds,
did you hear about the p... Party?

796
01:14:03,748 --> 01:14:04,999
You coming?

797
01:14:05,166 --> 01:14:07,043
- A picture here
of the enemy they're...

798
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:09,545
Does man deserve to be saved,
Mr. Heep?

799
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:11,839
- What?
- Man.

800
01:14:15,343 --> 01:14:16,844
Yes.

801
01:14:17,303 --> 01:14:19,096
That's not the answer I expected.

802
01:14:22,263 --> 01:14:22,892
Why'd you a... Ask me that?

803
01:14:23,226 --> 01:14:25,436
I know about your family.

804
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,898
I looked you up
when you started working here.

805
01:14:29,649 --> 01:14:31,943
I know someone killed them.

806
01:14:32,109 --> 01:14:36,614
But you can't give up.
You can't hide here, son.

807
01:14:38,157 --> 01:14:39,700
I know.

808
01:14:42,867 --> 01:14:42,286
You don't wanna become like me.

809
01:14:43,538 --> 01:14:47,458
By the way, your invitation would sound
more real if it had the guy's name on it.

810
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:50,711
There's something strange going on
around this building.

811
01:14:50,878 --> 01:14:52,755
Don't think I haven't noticed.

812
01:14:59,971 --> 01:15:01,639
It is finished?

813
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:07,311
You can see things in the future?

814
01:15:07,478 --> 01:15:09,480
Some things.

815
01:15:12,981 --> 01:15:12,441
I have a question to ask you.

816
01:15:16,276 --> 01:15:16,571
I will do my best to answer it.

817
01:15:16,737 --> 01:15:18,948
You'll tell me the truth, right?

818
01:15:20,366 --> 01:15:21,909
Yes.

819
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:26,497
Change doesn't happen the way
you say it's gonna happen...

820
01:15:26,664 --> 01:15:30,293
...without dramatic events
that accelerate thinking.

821
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:32,587
I wrote this thing.

822
01:15:32,753 --> 01:15:36,424
It might take decades or longer
to create a reaction...

823
01:15:39,883 --> 01:15:39,927
...before it anchors
in the consciousness.

824
01:15:40,595 --> 01:15:44,265
That's not the type of change
you're telling me is gonna happen, right?

825
01:15:49,058 --> 01:15:49,061
I was wondering
why he didn't meet me...

826
01:15:50,188 --> 01:15:52,732
...this leader who's just a boy.

827
01:15:53,316 --> 01:15:57,862
If he was so inspired by my words,
why didn't he try to meet me?

828
01:15:59,113 --> 01:16:03,159
There's a lot of things in The Cookbook
people won't like to hear.

829
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:10,958
I'm not anything, you know?
I don't think I'm anything special.

830
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:14,295
So I started thinking,
"How is this gonna happen?

831
01:16:14,462 --> 01:16:18,424
Why are people gonna suddenly
take me seriously?

832
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:21,636
And why didn't he meet me?"

833
01:16:27,847 --> 01:16:27,391
And I thought of how it could happen.

834
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:32,814
Story, I wanted to ask you,
is something gonna happen to me?

835
01:16:37,023 --> 01:16:37,401
Is someone gonna kill me
because I write this?

836
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,529
Yes.

837
01:16:43,029 --> 01:16:43,699
Man thinks they're each alone
in this world.

838
01:16:46,866 --> 01:16:46,077
It is not true.

839
01:16:46,661 --> 01:16:48,996
You are all connected.

840
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:53,209
One act can one day affect all.

841
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:01,801
What are you guys whispering about?

842
01:17:01,968 --> 01:17:05,012
Is he trying to get you to tell him
how many kids he's gonna have?

843
01:17:08,179 --> 01:17:08,266
I told him eight, all bratty boys.

844
01:17:11,432 --> 01:17:11,561
I asked her if she knew the name
of the deaf, dumb and blind guy...

845
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,396
...that's gonna marry you.

846
01:17:16,563 --> 01:17:16,732
Very funny, Herb.

847
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,412
Okay.

848
01:17:31,122 --> 01:17:33,499
Don't tell my sister.

849
01:18:04,614 --> 01:18:08,493
Hi. I'm Mr. Farber.

850
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:12,914
I wanted to thank you.

851
01:18:13,372 --> 01:18:18,419
I was completely surprised by all of this.

852
01:18:18,878 --> 01:18:22,965
I was expecting some kind of greeting,
of course.

853
01:18:27,383 --> 01:18:27,386
But this is beyond my expectations.

854
01:18:29,806 --> 01:18:31,891
I'm 13B.

855
01:18:35,767 --> 01:18:35,978
- Oh, yeah. How you doing? What's up?
- Oh, yeah. Good for you.

856
01:18:40,605 --> 01:18:40,608
I know of your future, Cleveland.

857
01:18:41,108 --> 01:18:43,194
Do you wanna hear it?

858
01:18:43,361 --> 01:18:44,821
No.

859
01:18:47,448 --> 01:18:51,160
Tell me what happens
when the eagle takes you back.

860
01:18:54,577 --> 01:18:54,705
It is only what I have been told
by others.

861
01:18:55,164 --> 01:19:00,503
They tell us the world will line up
and reveal we are on the right path...

862
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:03,047
...that the universe will give us signs.

863
01:19:06,881 --> 01:19:06,133
The Tartutic could have not come yet.

864
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:09,679
I can still sense
the scrunt's presence near.

865
01:19:10,179 --> 01:19:15,309
You have to believe
that this all makes sense somehow.

866
01:19:21,688 --> 01:19:21,524
I don't know why I'm the Madam Narf.

867
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:26,779
I'm not special. I'm clumsy.
They make fun of me.

868
01:19:29,946 --> 01:19:29,365
I don't know how to lead.

869
01:19:31,075 --> 01:19:35,121
Do you get sick
every time you break a rule?

870
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:39,167
Every time that you tell me
something that you shouldn't?

871
01:19:42,336 --> 01:19:44,922
There's a storm coming.

872
01:19:48,634 --> 01:19:52,722
- I am scared.
- It's okay to be scared.

873
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:55,641
I do not have courage.

874
01:19:56,309 --> 01:19:58,436
I do not want to be a Madam Narf.

875
01:19:58,603 --> 01:20:00,938
You do what you think is right.

876
01:20:01,105 --> 01:20:03,566
You are very brave.

877
01:20:07,442 --> 01:20:07,862
You were always meant to lead, Story.

878
01:20:10,990 --> 01:20:12,783
Cleveland...

879
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,829
...the Great Eatlon is coming.

880
01:21:29,443 --> 01:21:30,862
Okay.

881
01:21:34,532 --> 01:21:36,826
I'm glad you read my journal.

882
01:21:37,952 --> 01:21:41,664
Don't worry. We're all watching you.

883
01:22:18,698 --> 01:22:18,784
Oh, come on.
The music should have started already.

884
01:22:23,495 --> 01:22:23,122
Do not leave this spot.

885
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:27,960
- Yo, come on.
- Hey.

886
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:38,763
Find a mirror.

887
01:23:35,775 --> 01:23:35,987
Why hasn't the m... Music started?

888
01:23:39,154 --> 01:23:39,615
It's been working smooth.
We've been playing with it all night.

889
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:43,244
You used up the battery.

890
01:23:43,494 --> 01:23:45,288
Wave to him.

891
01:23:57,922 --> 01:23:57,216
They told her that the universe
would line up...

892
01:23:57,383 --> 01:24:01,304
...and reveal that we're
on the right p... Path.

893
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:03,890
Why isn't this working?

894
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:33,252
Okay.

895
01:24:46,599 --> 01:24:50,019
Sometimes animals just look dead.

896
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:58,861
Something went wrong.
They took her inside, up by the pool.

897
01:25:31,891 --> 01:25:31,853
It is not time for you to go.

898
01:25:34,147 --> 01:25:38,693
It is not time for you to go.

899
01:25:49,242 --> 01:25:49,162
Isn't this supposed to work?

900
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:57,044
Fourteen across.

901
01:25:59,088 --> 01:26:00,715
No. No.

902
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,472
I don't know.

903
01:26:09,015 --> 01:26:10,808
I don't know.

904
01:26:14,228 --> 01:26:18,774
This world is about finding
your purpose, right?

905
01:26:18,941 --> 01:26:23,279
And the only way to do that is to find
your own voice. You told us that.

906
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:27,283
I don't feel like an Interpreter.

907
01:26:27,867 --> 01:26:31,120
Is it possible that that isn't my purpose?

908
01:26:32,455 --> 01:26:36,751
I mean, I don't see anything
in these words, and I didn't before.

909
01:26:42,545 --> 01:26:42,131
And finding one's purpose
is a profound thing.

910
01:26:45,298 --> 01:26:45,301
Sometimes it isn't always
what it seems.

911
01:26:48,805 --> 01:26:50,765
What if these young men
are not the Guild?

912
01:26:50,932 --> 01:26:52,517
Look at what happened at the party.

913
01:26:55,683 --> 01:26:55,102
These things haven't seemed right
from the beginning.

914
01:26:58,269 --> 01:26:58,898
Why are you so certain that I am
the Interpreter and they are the Guild?

915
01:27:06,611 --> 01:27:06,155
He was so sure.

916
01:27:06,322 --> 01:27:07,740
What?

917
01:27:08,199 --> 01:27:09,867
I...

918
01:27:11,244 --> 01:27:13,538
...asked someone.

919
01:27:13,704 --> 01:27:15,957
He acted like he knew.

920
01:27:16,123 --> 01:27:18,084
What kind of person
would be so arrogant...

921
01:27:21,251 --> 01:27:21,003
...to presume to know the intention
of another human being?

922
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:23,256
Who put this young girl's life
in jeopardy?

923
01:27:30,388 --> 01:27:32,140
Hello?

924
01:27:42,522 --> 01:27:42,859
Is the bathroom on this level working?

925
01:27:45,194 --> 01:27:47,488
A dog inside the building.

926
01:27:50,655 --> 01:27:50,616
Go. Shoo!

927
01:27:55,955 --> 01:27:57,707
Why, you're not a dog at all.

928
01:28:01,419 --> 01:28:03,087
My God.

929
01:28:06,713 --> 01:28:06,799
This is like a moment
from a horror movie.

930
01:28:11,551 --> 01:28:11,762
It is precisely the moment
where the mutation or beast...

931
01:28:11,929 --> 01:28:15,600
...will attempt to kill
an unlikable side character.

932
01:28:15,766 --> 01:28:19,937
But in stories where there
has been no prior cursing, nudity...

933
01:28:23,104 --> 01:28:23,316
...killing or death,
such as in a family film...

934
01:28:23,483 --> 01:28:27,403
...the unlikable character
will narrowly escape his encounter...

935
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:29,947
...and be referenced again
later in the story...

936
01:28:33,114 --> 01:28:33,284
...having learned valuable lessons.

937
01:28:33,868 --> 01:28:35,745
He may even be given
a humorous moment...

938
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:38,956
...to allow the audience
to feel good about him.

939
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:44,170
This is where I turn to run.

940
01:28:44,337 --> 01:28:46,756
You will leap for me.

941
01:28:46,923 --> 01:28:48,925
I will shut the door.

942
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:53,596
And you will land
a fraction of a second too late.

943
01:28:56,849 --> 01:28:58,684
Why would they lie to her
about Tartutic?

944
01:28:58,851 --> 01:29:02,355
These cannot just be fairy tales
they tell to make the narfs risk their lives.

945
01:29:02,522 --> 01:29:03,981
This has gotta be about faith.

946
01:29:07,148 --> 01:29:07,193
Her world works by different rules
than ours. She may not be dead.

947
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:10,321
- We need to be told what to do.
- We need to find the Interpreter.

948
01:29:13,488 --> 01:29:13,032
How are we suddenly
going to realize someone's purpose?

949
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:16,619
This is someone doing something ancient.
An ancient thing in modern times.

950
01:29:19,786 --> 01:29:19,622
It could be someone who sees purity
in what we see as mundane.

951
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:21,791
Sees the voice of God
in the ordinary.

952
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:24,126
He is someone who sees meaning
in the ordinary.

953
01:29:27,293 --> 01:29:27,797
Does anyone have any idea
who this is?

954
01:29:29,966 --> 01:29:31,509
My God.

955
01:29:33,636 --> 01:29:35,096
I do.

956
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:38,391
There is a message.

957
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:43,479
There is a ceremony to be done.

958
01:29:43,646 --> 01:29:45,940
You're doing great, Joey.

959
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:52,405
The hands of the Guild will be needed,
plus two others.

960
01:29:55,572 --> 01:29:55,408
Joey, who is the Guild?

961
01:29:57,785 --> 01:30:01,164
It is a ceremony of seven sisters.

962
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:03,875
Sisters? The Guild is women?

963
01:30:08,168 --> 01:30:08,171
They will touch together
with their hearts as one...

964
01:30:08,337 --> 01:30:10,798
...to bring strength to the moment.

965
01:30:10,965 --> 01:30:12,800
Nice, Joey.

966
01:30:18,344 --> 01:30:18,181
You will need a man
who has no secrets...

967
01:30:18,347 --> 01:30:22,143
...and one whose opinion
is highly respected as witnesses.

968
01:30:23,561 --> 01:30:28,357
All must hurry.
This will all be over in moments.

969
01:30:58,012 --> 01:31:00,515
Mr. Perez de la Torre.

970
01:31:01,182 --> 01:31:06,562
I need to speak with your
f... F... F... F... Five daughters.

971
01:31:11,150 --> 01:31:15,238
Honey? Honey,
there's some people here to see you.

972
01:31:22,286 --> 01:31:23,788
Sweetheart?

973
01:31:25,414 --> 01:31:27,834
He's probably rinsing his mouth.

974
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,919
He's got terrible breath.

975
01:31:30,086 --> 01:31:32,630
Don't tell him I told you.

976
01:31:50,019 --> 01:31:50,982
- Huge explosions
right in the very heart of the capital.

977
01:31:51,149 --> 01:31:56,404
Several explosions, I felt at least four
very close to the center of the city.

978
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:06,474
I think we have everybody.

979
01:33:09,352 --> 01:33:13,397
A man who has no secrets...

980
01:33:13,564 --> 01:33:19,028
...and one whose opinion
I greatly respect.

981
01:33:19,195 --> 01:33:23,366
They will be w... W... Witnesses.

982
01:33:23,533 --> 01:33:27,912
Will the Guild please come forward?

983
01:33:32,542 --> 01:33:34,126
Yeah.

984
01:33:35,336 --> 01:33:37,338
And you make seven.

985
01:33:38,047 --> 01:33:40,049
Seven sisters.

986
01:33:42,552 --> 01:33:44,470
Come, come.

987
01:33:46,806 --> 01:33:48,307
Yeah.

988
01:33:49,058 --> 01:33:51,352
Everything's right now.

989
01:33:56,107 --> 01:33:58,359
Come back to us now.

990
01:33:59,485 --> 01:34:03,656
Come back to us now, honey.
Come back to us.

991
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:11,789
I can't believe it.

992
01:34:11,956 --> 01:34:15,793
This is crazy. This woman
is probably dying as we're talking.

993
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,587
She needs to get to a hospital.

994
01:34:17,753 --> 01:34:21,966
This is not right. We can't just stand here
playing make-believe.

995
01:34:22,133 --> 01:34:24,927
I wanted to believe more than most.

996
01:34:25,511 --> 01:34:27,930
I wanna be like a child again.

997
01:34:31,431 --> 01:34:31,434
I needed to believe there's more
than this awfulness around us...

998
01:34:31,601 --> 01:34:33,311
...but at some point we have to stop.

999
01:34:33,478 --> 01:34:38,649
Mr. Leeds, it is time to prove
some stories are real.

1000
01:34:39,734 --> 01:34:41,777
I read it wrong.

1001
01:34:46,699 --> 01:34:48,451
It was my first time.

1002
01:34:51,618 --> 01:34:51,621
I thought it said, "She will lead
a ceremony of seven sisters...

1003
01:34:54,787 --> 01:34:54,123
...to bring strength to the moment."

1004
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:58,503
I looked at it again. It says "he."

1005
01:34:58,669 --> 01:35:04,467
"He will lead a ceremony of seven sisters
to bring strength to the moment."

1006
01:35:07,634 --> 01:35:07,929
Mrs. Bell is not the Healer.

1007
01:35:08,095 --> 01:35:10,306
It said the Healer could be a man.

1008
01:35:13,473 --> 01:35:13,017
But l... But l...
I saw a butterfly land right on her.

1009
01:35:13,184 --> 01:35:14,310
Butterflies?

1010
01:35:17,477 --> 01:35:17,939
Yeah, the bedtime story
said butterflies are drawn to the Healer.

1011
01:35:18,105 --> 01:35:20,566
But, Mr. Heep,
you brought that butterfly to me.

1012
01:35:20,733 --> 01:35:24,195
It caught my eye as you walked over.

1013
01:35:26,656 --> 01:35:28,074
I did?

1014
01:35:34,747 --> 01:35:36,582
Wait, no.

1015
01:35:36,749 --> 01:35:38,543
You must try.

1016
01:35:41,709 --> 01:35:41,921
- There's no time.
- I can't. I can't. I can't.

1017
01:35:42,088 --> 01:35:43,673
Shut up...

1018
01:35:44,674 --> 01:35:46,217
...and try.

1019
01:36:30,383 --> 01:36:30,636
Say something to bring out your energy.

1020
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:37,643
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

1021
01:36:43,608 --> 01:36:45,443
I should have been there.

1022
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:47,945
I am always gonna regret...

1023
01:36:50,072 --> 01:36:52,575
...just not being there.

1024
01:36:58,247 --> 01:37:00,750
I'll miss your faces.

1025
01:37:06,586 --> 01:37:06,255
Oh, they remind me of God.

1026
01:37:15,428 --> 01:37:15,348
I'm so lost without you guys.

1027
01:37:20,937 --> 01:37:26,484
I met this very nice lady,
and her name's Story.

1028
01:37:30,819 --> 01:37:30,238
And I think you would've liked her.

1029
01:37:33,115 --> 01:37:35,326
I think she might be...

1030
01:37:37,078 --> 01:37:39,080
...an angel...

1031
01:37:41,290 --> 01:37:43,960
...because she has to go home.

1032
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:51,008
I love you all.

1033
01:37:55,552 --> 01:37:55,221
I love you all so much.

Your sister will have seven children.

1036
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:01,329
You will see the first two.

1037
01:41:16,839 --> 01:41:20,718
Oh, my God. He's the Guardian.

Reggie!

1039
01:41:22,678 --> 01:41:24,972
Reggie! Reggie,
just keep looking in his eyes!

1040
01:41:25,139 --> 01:41:27,558
Keep looking in his eyes!
